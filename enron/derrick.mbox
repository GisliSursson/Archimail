James

Given Whalley's promotion, it looks like the Xcelerator will remain under Corporate, rather than moving to EWS as expected when we last spoke.  Given that change, would you like for me to continue to request support from Mark Haedicke's group or is there someone in the corporate area you'd rather I approach.  Whatever route you suggest is fine with me.

Most pressingly, I'd like to discuss our ability to compete with a company with which we've been in discussions -- if possible by the latter part of the week.

Thank you.

Heath

Jim,   as I mentioned to you earlier we are forging ahead with the Enron Corp. interests project in Europe.  We commenced our work based on discussions with Jim Fallon, Ray Bowen and others about a week ago and plan to pay the employees with funds currently held by EEFT.  I expect to receive tomorrow a formalized structure for the teams, again organized around EEFT.  As I understand it, however, this proposal will not address any retention bonuses for the teams because this issue is still under discussion.  I have been told that there is hesitancy on the part of some in Houston to provide for such payments but I do not know the reason for that hesitancy.  

May I suggest that it would be entirely appropriate to provide for retention payments in this case.  As I have mentioned, part of this project is to recover value from existing contracts in entities such as ECTRIC, which value is estimated in the aggregate to be $150 to 200 million.  Another aspect of the Corp. interest project is to properly wind up entities so as to recover value and minimize director liabilities.  A proposal was made that a percentage of the recovered value would be put into a bonus pool and shared among all of the team members, whether those individuals had focused on recovery of funds or minimizing liabilities.  I am told that this proposal was rejected in a conference call held today.

I am very concerned about our ability to keep people working on this project without some additional incentive.  The project is extremely difficult and many people, in particular the traders who are in a position to protect value in ECTRIC, have other job options.  In addition, the employees on the team are aware that many individuals who are working on PWC teams are receiving retention payments.  If the team to protect the ECTRIC interests is not retained in the short term, ECTRIC is scheduled to be put into administration on January 4, resulting in termination of many of its in-the-money contracts and a loss of an estimated 50% of its value. 

Jim, if you are inclined to support retention payments to help us maintain this effort going forward, will you please communicate that fact to Jim Fallon, Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen tomorrow, as it is likely we will begin to lose people after Christmas.  Thank you.

Jim, I do not know  if Ben or Kristina have counsel or if any other people who are getting worried  have made decisions yet but there is a former U. S.  Attorney  from Omaha, named Ed Warin at the McGrath North firm  with whom I've worked who is superb. I recognize that many of the Texas firms  may be conflicted and people may not be comfortable with all the Washington,  D.C. folks. This guy is an excellent lawyer,  knows his way around and is  very decent to work with.

Paula Rieker 
Rex Rogers

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.  We are only required to review Manager level and above however, we have the flexibility to review all (or some)  levels.  Please let me know how far down you would like to go on the review table.  My recommendation is that we may want to discuss at least down to the Sr Specialist level since there may be some nominations for promotion to Manager in this category.  If you have questions, please call me at Ext 30649.  Thanks.

Hi, Jim.

We had a great group of people working on the CLE committee this year.  The committee was a combination of people identified by the various general counsels, plus people I knew and thought would be reliable volunteers.  I believe that one of the current committee members would be a logical choice to chair next year's law conference CLE program.  (I know that I would have felt a little more confident had I sat on the committee before taking the helm).

Although most of the committee members contributed to the effort, any of  the following lawyers would be strong candidates to chair next year's CLE committee:  Carlos Sole, Rose Engeldorf, Michelle Hicks, Susan Scott, Marianne Castano, Brenda Funk, or Kriste Sullivan.  David Koogler, who was not an active member of the committee, but nonetheless was responsible for a speaker, also would be a good choice (in fact, for some reason, EBS is under the impression that it is next on the list, so David and Michelle would not be surprised if they were tapped for the job -- co-chairs may be a good idea).

Let me know if you have any questions or would like any more information on the committee or other aspects of the law conference CLE program.

As I mentioned in my voice mail, I enjoyed chairing the committee and thank you for the opportunity.

Michelle

Jim, I am so glad that the 2001 law conference went so well -- we have received many favorable comments from the attendees.  Today we had a post-conference meeting with the group that worked on the conference, and we went over what worked well and what didn't.  It was very productive.

One of the things that came out of our meeting was the need to promptly appoint next year's Chairman of the CLE committee.  Michelle feels that putting that person in place now will greatly aid in the transition from this year to next year's planning.  As a matter of fact, she is meeting with her committee for the last time next week and would love to announce the new chair at that time.

So, could you please think about to whom you would like to give that distinct honor?  I've asked Michelle to e-mail you information about her committee and her suggestions regarding a chair.

Thanks so much for your help and input.

John Quinn, one of our (many)litigators in California was approached by David Boies' firm about getting involved in the Quinque matter. He called me, learned that we were a defendant, and declined Boies' offer to get involved. I have attached the Boies firm response. I think the danger of allowing the Quinn Emmanuel firm to get involved far outweighs the benefit of getting a release. The release may be shortlived.  Enron could be added to Quinque or a Quinque copycat by another Plaintiffs atty. Furthurmore, their involvement in Quinque could result in the development of evidence adverse to our position in the Grynberg case. What are your thoughts?

I think it would be worth pursuing that option with your client.  If it
meant the involvement of your firm (to any significant extent), the
plaintiffs would likely agree to dismiss the Enron defendants.

Ken and Jeff:

Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.

Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.

If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.

I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.

Thanks.

Jim Hughes

Bruce-

I think Wade spoke to you last night about some concerns I have with our Indian litigation team.  Principally I am a bit disappointed with Atul Setalvad.  You and I have discussed this a little in the past and I've shared some of my frustrations.  Ultimately, and notwithstanding my grumbling to you and Gail, I would be willing to put up with arrogance, over-billing, criticism of Enron and the project and even (grudgingly) the disrespect with which he treats me and the other DPC lawyers if I thought he could get the job done.  But I don't think he can. 

He may still have some good ideas.  And he does have history with the project.  But he's slow.  And he's unresponsive to our schedule, our priorities and our instructions.  One reason we had to ask for more time from the MERC is that he simply wasn't prepared to argue yesterday.  I'm still not sure he's read MSEB's petition and I'm quite sure he has no idea what the substantive argument about misdeclaration is.  Under the glare of TV cameras and under pressure at yesterday's MERC hearing, I thought he choked.  In contrast, MSEB's advocate spoke persuasively about the PPA and the MERC.  I figure if he could get up to speed on the PPA and on misdeclaration, we can bring someone else up to speed as well.  We shouldn't be hiring the best lawyers in the UK and the States and then settling for the "B" team in India especially when MSEB has collected three of the best lawyers from  Delhi and Bombay.  

I'm not looking to totally dump the guy.  Even from a prudence perspective, we should have more than one senior lawyer ready to go.  If  we are going to be waging court wars on multiple fronts and on different issues, it would be irresponsible to stick with only one counsel.  We've identified three guys to approach and I think we should get them all up to speed and involved going forward.  When we need to deploy someone in a particular matter, we can choose among the three of them (and Atul S) and pick the individual most likely to be successful.  

1.	I'm meeting with P. Chidambaram here in Bombay  today.  He's opined for us on the misdeclaration issue in the past.  Very smart guy.  Former Finance Minister of India.  Well respected and someone I definitely want on our team.  

2.	We've also approached Ashok Desai in the past.  Former Attorney General of India and the mentor of MSEB's lawyer (the Advocate General of Maharashtra who appeared at the MERC yesterday).  Walker thought Desai would be particularly useful given the possible effect on MSEB's lawyer of having to argue against his former boss. We're not sure he's still available but I intend to find that out. I understand he is out of the country at the moment.  But we want to approach him in Early July when he gets back.  

3.	Last guy is a fellow named Parasaran.  Reputed to be one of the two best lawyers in India (the number one guy - Fali Nariman - is already working against us).  We have not spoken to him yet.  He may already have accepted a brief from MSEB, GOM or GOI.   If not, we will try to approach him. 

Finally, although less urgently, I think we need more litigation support.  Shoban is terribly smart and has the same depth of experience of Atul R. and Atul S.  But he's ill equipped to support the fight we're undertaking.  He has no associates.  He has no secretaries.  He can't research case law.  He's only available from 10 - 6.  When we need to prepare submissions to court, inevitably he calls us up and sheepishly asks whether we can do it ourselves.  Which we've stayed here late at night in the past and done.  But I'm not sure we can handle procedural litigation support on top of everything else we're doing.  

Again, I'm not proposing we replace him.  And I'm not even sure we have a firm in mind to help out with this stuff right at the moment (we're considering 1.  Desai & Diwanji, 2. Amarchand and 3. A firm called Doijode & Phartephekar).  But I do think we're going to need a firm to back us up with junior associates willing to pull cases and crunch out filings 24 hours a day.  Again, no point in putting together a crack legal team from the States and England when we can't deliver the goods here in Bombay.  

I realize the risk of suggesting new players.  If we tank, the first thing Jim and Rob will ask is "Why did we ever change from Setalvad?  Who are these new guys?"  quickly followed by "Paul Kraske has left Enron to pursue other interests".  But I would be remiss not to bring my reservations to your attention and to strongly suggest that we add more guys to the team.  I'm also willing to have this discussion with Rob and, if necessary, with Jim.  Atul R. is still preparing the writ petition but I want to act a little quickly on the Senior Counsel front so we can line up either Ashok Desai or Chidambaram to argue the writ before the High Court. 

Let me know what you think.  

Paul

CHANGES CONSIDERED TO RELAX RULES FOR CERTAIN WETLANDS
PERMITS

Rules prohibiting development activities affecting 300
linear feet of stream bed would be relaxed in certain
circumstances under changes to the wetlands program being
contemplated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The corps
is considering changes to several of its nationwide permits,
which authorize activities in up to a half-acre of wetlands,
according to a corps spokesman.  The revisions come slightly
more than a year after the corps published its package of
new and revised nationwide permits, which included lowering
the allowable amount of wetlands that could be impacted from
three acres to a half-acre. . . . Page AA-1,  E-1

SUPREME COURT DECLINES REVIEW OF DECISION UPHOLDING PCB
DISPOSAL RULE

The U.S. Supreme Court announces that it will not review a
federal appeals court decision that upheld an EPA regulation
on polychlorinated biphenyl use and disposal. The court
leaves standing an August 2000 decision by the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals, which largely upheld the rule, known as
the PCB Mega Rule. The Supreme Court denies review without

BUSH PRAISES EVERGLADES RESTORATION, CALLS FOR 'NEW
ENVIRONMENTALISM'

President Bush seeks to firm up his environmental
credentials by pointing to his administration's request for
$219 million for restoration of the Everglades and by
calling for a "new environmentalism." The money is part of
the federal government's commitment to an Everglades
restoration effort enacted last year. Bush points to
cooperation in the Everglades project as an example of the
"new environmentalism for the 21st century." . . . Page A-1

REFINERY FOUND LIABLE FOR VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL LAW, DESPITE
STATE ACTIONS

A petroleum refiner is liable for violations of various
federal laws despite the initiation of a state enforcement
action, a federal district court rules. The U.S. District
Court for the Western District of Wisconsin grants partial
summary judgment to the federal government on its claims
that Murphy Oil USA Inc. is liable for violations of the
Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act at its refinery in Superior,
Wis. The court rejects Murphy's claims that the initiation
of state enforcement actions precludes EPA from bringing its
claims. . . . Page A-2

EPA's new strategy for cleaning up the Great Lakes Basin
places a heavy emphasis on reducing persistent

EPA CIRCULATES DRAFT OF ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES FOR FISCAL
2002, 2003

EPA is putting the finishing touches on a list of
enforcement priorities for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 that
builds on progress made in six major areas during the
previous two-year period, but budget cutbacks will force
some consolidation in programs, an agency official tells

NINTH CIRCUIT HALTS TIMBER SALES TO PROTECT SALMON HABITAT,
WATER QUALITY

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upholds a
lower court's ruling that halted a number of federal timber
sales in Oregon because of endangered species and water
quality concerns. The ruling affirms a 1999 ruling by the
district court which directed federal biologists to do more
site-specific studies of the impact of the timber sales on
salmon habitat and water quality. . . . Page A-10

EPA ASSIGNS LOW ENFORCEMENT PRIORITY TO AQUATIC HERBICIDE
DECISION

EPA will not change its civil enforcement priorities on
pesticides applied to water until the agency develops a
concerted national approach to regulate such activities,
according to a memorandum from EPA's Office of Enforcement
and Compliance Assurance. The memorandum refers to a federal
appeals court ruling that an irrigation district in Oregon
may be subject to liability under the Clean Water Act
because it failed to obtain a permit to spray aquatic
herbicides on its canals. . . . Page A-5

Dear TI-USA Corporate Supporters:

We are delighted to report that yesterday the OAS General Assembly approved a
resolution calling for the creation of a follow-up mechanism for the
Inter-American Convention Against Corruption.  As you know, TI has been
working toward this goal for over two years.

The agreement provides for a Committee of Experts to select the provisions of
the Convention and countries to be reviewed and for the possibility of
consultations with civil society.

TI has called for additional steps including:

-Clear instructions to enable civil society participation in the follow-up
monitoring and guarantee a transparent and participatory process, with the
publication of questionnaires and responses, and consultations with civil
society organizations, professional organizations, academia and the private
sector;

-Funding to underpin civil society input;

-In-country visits by experts to provide the best possible objective and
independent technical expertise to act on any shortfalls in the
implementation and enforcement of the Convention;

-Meetings of experts by the Fall of 2001, and evaluations before the end of
this year;

-An annual progress report.

Jim:  We are close to making an offer to someone to replace Ann Ballard (of course, I will visit with you about this before before we extend any offers to get your approval).  Until then, we are a little short handed, and don't know that we could take on any extra work.  Perhaps Haedicke's group, which is obviously much bigger than ours, could continue to do this at least until we add another person and then reassess the situation.  That would be my suggestion, but of course we are ready to serve if drafted! (I spoke to Tom White yesterday and I am ready to enlist!  Lucky for us that I can't pass the physical).  Rex

James

Given Whalley's promotion, it looks like the Xcelerator will remain under Corporate, rather than moving to EWS as expected when we last spoke.  Given that change, would you like for me to continue to request support from Mark Haedicke's group or is there someone in the corporate area you'd rather I approach.  Whatever route you suggest is fine with me.

Most pressingly, I'd like to discuss our ability to compete with a company with which we've been in discussions -- if possible by the latter part of the week.

Thank you.

Subject:	ENRON EUROPE


Mark, Rob

My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.

Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: 

1. Continuing to trade

The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. 

The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  

I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. 


2. Filing accounts

The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. 

I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? 

We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? 


That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. 

Many thanks.



								Mark

Gentlemen -

A few updates:

   The lender meetings in Singapore this week have been challenging.  The
   Indian banks are trying to induce the foreign banks to fund into a
   project with a repudiated PPA.  It is becoming more apparent to us that
   the Indian banks are being heavily influenced by the Government of India
   and not acting as commercial institutions.  Our business people do not
   believe that all or most foreign banks will continue funding at this
   point.  It is likely that the Indian banks could act on their own to
   cure the construction contract payments which give rise to termination
   this month (about $34 million).  Within a few months, however, the
   Indian bank facility would be fully funded.

   Today, we filed our writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging
   MERC's jurisdiction.  While we have a hearing date scheduled on Monday,
   there is some doubt whether or not we will get a hearing on that date.

Jim:
 
As I mentioned in  our phone call, the Special Committee asked me to pass on two instructions to  the Company:
 
1.  Enron  should make no severance or other payments to Andrew Fastow without first  bringing the matter to the Special Committee and obtaining its consent.  I  understand you will pass this instruction on to the appropriate  personnel.
 
2.  I  understand that the Company is preparing to circulate its conflicts  questionnaire to all employees within the next few days.  Please have the  personnel handling this process show us the form to be used, so we can  supplement the questions as appropriate in light of our current  investigation.  I understand Sharon Butcher is the person working on this  matter, and that you will have her contact us.
 
As always, thanks  very much for your help.
 
Chuck

Jim,  Hannah and I are so appreciative of your efforts in establishing the  
Frank Smith Memorial Golf Tournament at the annual Enron Law Conference.  The  
joy you have brought to our daughter through this gesture is immeasurable-  
and we believe, after the initial mortification at having his name on  
anything, that Frank would have been thrilled about it- (in an understated  
way, of course, but thrilled nonetheless).  Heartfelt thanks for your  
involvement and contribution to this effort. 
I am sending, either attached to this e-mail or separately, (depends on  
challenges presented as I am hugely incompetent in this area) the e-mail we  
received from Dave Nutt explaining the evolution of the tournament.  It is a  
ringing endorsement of your efforts and character and I think you should be  
aware of it.   
We thank you for remembering, in such a loving way, one of the finest people  
God ever put on this planet!  Sue Smith   
P.S. Please let me know if you receive Dave's letter attached to this e-mail  
(sorry!)

EPA ISSUES TWO RADIATION STANDARDS FOR YUCCA MOUNTAIN
REPOSITORY

EPA upholds stringent radiation standards for the proposed
Yucca Mountain high-level nuclear waste repository in
Nevada. In its final version of radiation standards for
Yucca Mountain, EPA lets stand the 15 millirem per year
standard it proposed in 1999 for all pathways of exposure.
EPA issues a separate 4 millirem standard for radiation in
ground water. The EPA standard wins guarded support from
opponents of the Yucca Mountain facility. . . . Page AA-1

SCIENCE PANEL TELLS WHITE HOUSE GLOBAL WARMING LIKELY TO
CONTINUE

Greenhouse gas emissions are still causing the Earth to
warm, and more research is needed to curtail existing
uncertainties in climate change science, a committee of the
National Research Council advises the White House. "We know
that greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's
atmosphere, causing surface temperatures to rise," writes
the committee chairman. The committee says it was not part
of the committee's charge to make policy recommendations for
dealing with potential effects of climate change. . . . Page

NORTON PROMISES INTERIOR WILL HONOR BANS ON OFFSHORE OIL,
GAS DRILLING

The Bush administration will respect congressional bans on
offshore oil and gas drilling, but may investigate the need
to change the law, Interior Secretary Norton tells a House
committee during a hearing on the Bush administration's
National Energy Policy Report. . . . Page A-2

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT STRIKES MOST VIRGINIA RESTRICTIONS ON
TRASH IMPORTS

Provisions of Virginia's solid waste management law, enacted
to limit the amount of out-of-state waste that can be taken
to landfills in the state, violate the U.S. Constitution, a
federal appeals court rules. The U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit says four of five provisions, enacted in
1999 in response to the growth of regional landfills in the
state and an influx of municipal solid waste from New York
and elsewhere, violate constitutional restrictions on state
action.  . . . Page A-2

FUNGICIDE TASK FORCE SEEKS MORE TIME FOR CARBAMATE
ASSESSMENT

A deadline for grouping carbamate pesticides for a
cumulative risk assessment should be flexible, an industry
task force writes in comments to EPA. The Dec. 31 deadline
was set by EPA and the Natural Resources Defense Council in
a consent decree, which also imposed additional deadlines on
EPA for its pesticide reassessments and which could be
approved by a federal court next week. . . . Page A-5

ADMINISTRATION REQUESTS FUNDS FOR CLEANUP OF URANIUM WASTE
SITE

Lobbying efforts by a bipartisan group of lawmakers lead the
Bush administration to add $1.4 million to its fiscal year
2002 budget request to plan the cleanup of a southern Utah
uranium waste site. Contamination from the site could
threaten the Colorado River, a major source of drinking
water for 25 million residents in western states. . . . Page

RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS DECIDE TO ALLOW IMPORT OF SPENT NUCLEAR
FUEL

Russia's parliament approves a legislative package that
would allow the country to import spent nuclear fuel from
abroad. The government, which strongly lobbied for the
bills, hopes to make about $20 billion by importing spent
nuclear fuel for reprocessing and storage in Russia. To
become law, the bills still must be approved by parliament's
upper house and signed by President Putin. . . . Page A-9

CONFIDENTIAL DATA SOUGHT ON EFFECT OF BIOTECH CROPS ON
BUTTERFLIES

The Union of Concerned Scientists asks EPA to release
confidential data on the effects of biotech crops on the
Monarch butterfly. In a Freedom of Information Act request,
the group seeks data generated by academic and government
scientists and submitted to EPA by makers of
plant-incorporated protectants. A substantial part of the
data being sought on Bt corn and the Monarch is claimed as
confidential. . . . Page A-6

SUPPORT OFFERED FOR DOT PROPOSAL ON SHORT HAZARDOUS LIQUID
PIPELINES

Pipeline safety experts and portions of regulated industry
file comments in support of a Department of Transportation
proposal to extend integrity management requirements to
shorter hazardous liquid pipelines. The proposed rule would
affect pipelines shorter than 500 miles that pass through
highly populated or environmentally sensitive areas. . . .

U.S., SINGAPORE TRADE TALKS COULD BE SLOWED BY ENVIRONMENT
ISSUE

The continuing dispute between Republicans and Democrats in
Congress over how to handle labor and environmental issues
in trade negotiations could slow talks now under way between
the United States and Singapore for a free trade agreement,
the first between the United States and an Asian nation, by
the end of the year. . . . Page A-11

CORROSION BLAMED FOR RUPTURED PIPELINE CAUSING OIL SPILL IN
BRAZIL

A ruptured pipeline spills 200,000 liters (52,000 gallons)
of fuel oil in a suburb of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city,
causing serious damage to several homes. The state oil
company Petrobras says the pipeline was carrying residual
fuel oil from one Petrobras refinery in southeastern Sao
Paulo state to another for processing. . . . Page A-8

Jim,  your resignation pertained to your directorship with the Enron Poland entity which was the marketing and origination entity for Poland.  You are still a director for ENS which is the comapny that holds the Polish power plant.  I have confirmed with the other directors that this meeting is in regard to operational and contractual matters and you need not attend.  It would be helpful if you sent an e:mail with your regrets to:    Jacek.Glowacki@enron.com

Gentlemen -

On Saturday, we received the consent required from the lenders to serve Preliminary Termination Notices (PTNs) on MSEB under the PPA.  The consent allows us to serve PTNs for basically every bad act committed by our Indian counterparts to date.  We will need further lender approval to serve PTNs for future bad acts.

On Saturday, we served PTNs on MSEB for (a) failure to pay certain amounts under the PPA and (b) repudiation by MSEB of the PPA.  There are a few more PTNs that will be served on MSEB in early June -- the underlying defaults for these PTNs required a 60 day notice period before service of a PTN and these notices were served in early April.

Paul Kraske, General Counsel of Dabhol Power Company, told me that he receives 4 Indian newspapers (including national newspapers) at his apartment.  On Sunday, our service of the PTNs was the lead story in all 4 newspapers.

Bruce

Hi, Jim - - -Paula Rieker seems like a great choice to be Corporate
Secretary. She is a wonderful human being, with a tough inner constitution
and a lot of empathy for others.  So, you two have a lot in common. And, as
I'm sure you know, she is a cancer survivor, of a type another friend of
mine died from. She would also be a great addition to the Vision and Values
Committee, if she's not already on it, as well as any effort to reform and
humanize the PRC.  Congratulations on this great addition to your team. I
just wish that we had more people with values like the two of you and Rob
better dispersed throughout the leadership of some of our  commercial
groups! - - -DLH

ALBANIA

-=09Grenade explodes in market, nine injured

In an example of the lack of safety in Albanian public life, Albanian polic=
e chief Bilbil Mema announced on Tuesday, May 29, that a grenade exploded i=
n a central Tirana fruit and vegetable market. The Chinese-made grenade inj=
ured nine people, two of them seriously. Although police have yet to determ=
ine a motive for the attack, it is likely related to ongoing battles among =
organized criminal elements in the country. Fueled by the active black mark=
et for arms that grew during the breakup of the Yugoslav Federation, Albani=
a over the past decade has become a hotbed for organized crime and a pictur=
e of instability. The consequent turf battles and bombings in public spaces=
 that endanger innocent passers by makes safety a major concern when travel=
ing to Albania. (Control Risks, May 31, 2001)

ALGERIA

-=09U.S. State Department Travel Warning

The United States Department of State warns U.S. citizens to evaluate caref=
ully the implications for their security and safety before deciding to trav=
el to Algeria. Although considerably fewer terrorist incidents have taken p=
lace in Algeria over the last three years, unpredictable attacks still occu=
r in rural villages, on roadsides and public transport, and at night. The m=
ost recent terrorist activity has occurred in rural areas in northern Alger=
ia. At the height of terrorist violence in Algeria, many commercial airline=
s cancelled service to and from Algeria. Since then, a number of carriers h=
ave resumed service, including one western airline. Most official foreign t=
ravel by U.S. Government employees and visitors is via chartered aircraft, =
although commercial carriers are sometimes used. The Department of State st=
rongly recommends that those Americans who travel to Algeria exercise maxim=
um caution and take prudent measures.  These include limiting use of regula=
rly scheduled commercial flights and being met and accompanied by pre-arran=
ged local contacts upon arrival and departure at airports. Nighttime and ov=
erland travel should be avoided.  Visitors to Algiers should stay only in t=
he large, internationally recognized hotels where security is provided. U.S=
. citizens should not move anywhere in Algeria unless accompanied by a know=
n Algerian companion. This applies to walking the streets of Algiers and ot=
her cities. U.S. Embassy personnel take all of the precautions mentioned ab=
ove. In addition, embassy employees and official visitors are restricted to=
 the embassy compound or their hotels except as necessary to conduct offici=
al business or limited personal business in the capital. All travel by offi=
cial Americans in Algiers is by armored car with appropriate security. U.S.=
 oil companies operating in the desert region south of the Saharan Atlas Mo=
untains have experienced no attacks in the past year. The Algerian governme=
nt and the companies themselves take stringent security precautions to ensu=
re their safety, including many of the measures described above. For furthe=
r information on travel to Algeria, please consult the Department of State'=
s latest Consular Information Sheet on Algeria at http://travel.state.gov. =
This replaces the Travel Warning dated March 31, 2000, to address the chang=
ing security conditions in Algeria. (U.S. State Department, May 31, 2001)

-=09Protests in Algiers and Oran as unrest in Kabylie continues

Peaceful protests took place in Algiers and Oran against the government and=
 in support of the Kabylie protesters on Monday, May 28. Riots and clashes =
with security forces in the Kabylie region continued over May 25-28, notabl=
y in Tizi Ouzou, Bejaia and Bouira, and unrest spread to the Boumerdes regi=
on. The protests in Algiers and Oran were both against a restrictive draft =
press law against the actions of the security forces in the Kabylie region.=
 The unrest in the Kabyle region is expected to continue in the short term.=
 There is a possibility that the cycle of mass protests, repression and unr=
est could spread to Algiers and Oran. Personnel planning trips to the count=
ry should monitor the situation closely and should postpone travel to Kabyl=
ie until the region stabilizes. The unrest will not affect the oil-producin=
g regions of Hassi Messaoud and Hassi R'Mel. (Control Risks, May 29, 2001)

ARGENTINA

-=09Protesters threaten to block international flights

Members of the Aeronautic Workers' Association (APA) on Monday, May 28, att=
empted to block Iberia flight 6844 out of Ezeiza International Airport, wer=
e demanding payment of April salaries. Protesters threatened to block all i=
nternational flights from May 29 if the national airline Aerolineas Argenti=
nas continued to refuse to pay the salaries. This is likely to create delay=
s, with particular focus on Spanish airlines SpanAir, Air Plur and Iberia. =
However, all business travelers are advised to contact their airlines for t=
he latest information and to establish whether alternative travel arrangeme=
nts have been made. Furthermore, it is expected that disruption to Aeroline=
as Argentinas flights and to those of its domestic subsidiary Austral will =
continue. Personnel are advised to monitor the situation, expect demonstrat=
ions and a heavy police presence at the airport and avoid all protests to m=
inimize their exposure to incidental violence. (Control Risks, May 29, 2001=

BAHRAIN

-=09Heightened terrorist threat alert for US military=20

US military forces in Bahrain are on a higher state of alert after a weeken=
d threat against American targets there, US officials reportedly said. The =
roughly 1,400 US military personnel were ordered to move to the Pentagon's =
second-highest state of alert after "a specific threat," the officials said=
, and are meant to warn that some form of terrorist action is imminent; alt=
hough, the particular target had not been identified. Pentagon officials to=
ld media the alert is not related to the May 29 conviction in a New York co=
urt of four terrorists believed by the US to be connected to terrorist susp=
ect Osama bin Laden. The four were convicted of conspiracy in the 1998 bomb=
ings of two US Embassies in East Africa in which 224 people died. US forces=
 in the Persian Gulf region were last ordered to Threat Condition Delta, th=
e highest alert, after the October terrorist bombing of the destroyer USS C=
ole in the Yemeni port of Aden that killed 17 US sailors and wounded 35 oth=
ers. No equivalent warning has been issued by the US State Department; alth=
ough, it cautioned of a sustained threat of possibly politically motivated =
violence in Bahrain arising from continuing regional tensions. (Control Ris=

BANGLADESH

-=09Islamist protests possible at conference in Dhaka on June 1-2

A conference entitled 'Fundamentalism and communalism in South Asia', which=
 is being held on Friday and Saturday, June 1-2, at the Osmani Memorial Aud=
itorium in Dhaka, is expected to attract protests from conservative Islamic=
 organizations. Religious organizations in Bangladesh are extremely sensiti=
ve to criticism and the authorities' efforts to restrict their role in soci=
ety, and will object to the conference, which has been set up to discuss th=
e ways in which the spread of religious extremism can be prevented in the r=
egion. Personnel should avoid any protests that take place to reduce the ri=
sk of being involved in any clashes between protesters and security force p=
ersonnel. (Control Risks, May 31, 2001)

BOLIVIA

-=09Farmers' union threatens further action for July 1

Leader of the Bolivian Confederation of Rural Workers' Unions (CSUTCB) Feli=
pe Quispe on Monday, May 28, warned of renewed direct action after July 1. =
The warning comes over the government's inability to keep promises that it =
made to end the previous round of protests that paralyzed much of the count=
ry between April 9 and May 3. This inability will cause further protests an=
d social unrest will remain high. If the main trades union confederation th=
e Bolivian Workers Confederation (COB) fails to receive concessions from th=
e government on its separate demands, protests are likely to once again mak=
e travel and communication extremely difficult. The COB has shown recently =
that it has the organizational power to cause major disturbances when it ch=
ooses, though these are largely peaceful. Protests are likely to continue u=
ntil a satisfactory solution can be found. (Control Risks, May 30, 2001)

BRAZIL

-=09Veteran political leader resigns from Senate, attacks government

Veteran political leader and key government ally Ant?nio Carlos Magalh?es o=
f the centre-right Liberal Front Party (PFL) resigned his Senate (Upper Hou=
se) seat on Wednesday, May 30, rather than face expulsion over allegations =
of breaking the secrecy of a Senate vote. The government hopes that such a =
high-profile resignation will satisfy opposition parties who have been push=
ing for a full congressional inquiry into high-level corruption allegations=
. However, as corruption will become a key campaign issue, it remains to be=
 seen whether several key pro-business reforms that are currently before Co=
ngress will be passed before campaigning begins in earnest. Magalh?es may n=
ow be tempted to reveal his extensive knowledge of public corruption and he=
 is unlikely to back the coalition candidate in the 2002 presidential elect=
ion. Travel Up to 50,000 people are expected to demonstrate on May 31 and J=
une 1 in the central Lago de Pelourinho area of Salvador (Bahia state) in s=
upport of Magalh?es. Business travelers should expect some disruption to tr=
ansport and avoid demonstrations if possible, because of possible criminal =
activity. (Control Risks, May 31, 2001)

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

-=09U.S. State Department Travel Warning

The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to defer travel to the Central =
African Republic due to the uncertain security situation following an attem=
pted coup in the capital city of Bangui. On May 28, military forces loyal t=
o former President Kolingba launched an attack on a number of government an=
d military installations. There are reports of sporadic fighting in Bangui =
and its suburbs; other regions of the Central African Republic remain calm.=
  Bangui's international airport is under government control but is closed =
to regularly scheduled commercial air service. Although the conflict does n=
ot appear to be directed toward U.S. citizens or the general civilian popul=
ation, the U.S. Embassy has advised U.S. citizens in Bangui to review their=
 personal security situations and to remain in their homes until the situat=
ion stabilizes. The Embassy has temporarily suspended operations to the pub=
lic, and its ability to provide consular assistance to U.S. citizens in the=
 Central African Republic is severely limited. American citizens needing em=
ergency assistance should contact the Embassy by calling (236) 61-0200. For=
 further information on travel to the Central African Republic, consult the=
 Department's latest Consular Information Sheet for the Central African Rep=
ublic available via the Internet at http://travel.state.gov. (U.S. State De=
partment, May 30, 2001)

-=09Nationwide curfew, military operations in southern Bangui follow attemp=
ted coup

President Ange Felix Patasse declared a curfew in the capital Bangui on Mon=
day, May 28, following the suppression of an attempted coup. Reports on the=
 morning of May 29 suggested that automatic weapon fire was taking place am=
id continuing military operations in southern Bangui. Personnel should main=
tain a low profile and where possible remain indoors, observing the terms o=
f a nationwide 6:00 am to 6:00 pm curfew. All visits to the south of the ca=
pital, and to the vicinity of the presidential residence at which the coup =
attempt took place, should be postponed until the level of uncertainty has =
decreased. The possibility of further fighting and instability is credible.=
 The reports of shots being fired in southern Bangui on May 29 almost certa=
inly reflect the security forces' efforts to eliminate the source of the co=
up attempt. Business travelers scheduled to visit Bangui may wish to defer =
travel until the situation stabilizes. (Control Risks, May 29, 2001)

CHILE

-=09Major crimes up sharply

Serious crimes increased significantly in Chile during the first trimester =
of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000. The number of reports of viole=
nt assault rose 42.4 percent while cases of murder or rape rose 51 and 42 p=
ercent respectively. Robberies rose by 10 percent while burglaries increase=
d 18 percent. Overall, crimes against persons rose 43.6 percent, while crim=
es against property rose by 12.9 percent. The year before, assaults had ris=
en by 31.7 percent in 2000 over 1999. Santiago and its suburbs were the are=
as hit hardest by the increases in crime. The number of arrests also rose, =
but by smaller percentages. Chile remains one of the safest countries for v=
isitors in Latin America. Nonetheless, as these statistics demonstrate, the=
 rate of crime is increasing in Chile. Victims who do not resist are usuall=
y not harmed. Street crime is a problem in metropolitan Santiago in general=
 and specifically in the city center. In 1999, thirty-eight people were kil=
led in robbery attempts; of these 23 were shot, 11 were stabbed, and four w=
ere killed with blunt objects. (Pinkerton, May 30, 2001)

COLOMBIA

-=09Attack leaves eight dead

On Wednesday, May 30, approximately eight people were killed in the norther=
n village of Los Tupes when a group of armed men dressed in camouflage thre=
w grenades at homes during an early morning attack. The region has a heavy =
National Liberation Army (ELN) presence. (Air Security, May 31, 2001)

-=09Small bomb attacks in Cali continue fears of urban terrorist campaign

Two small bombs exploded in Cali in the early hours of Sunday, May 27, inju=
ring one man. The first device exploded outside a suburban police station. =
No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks though government and s=
ecurity force installations are favored targets of leftist insurgent groups=
. The spate of recent car bombings and attempted car bombings has raised fe=
ars of an urban terrorism campaign similar to that mounted in the later 198=
0s and early 1990s by the large drug cartels. Consequently, security has be=
en stepped up in Bogota, Medellin, Cali and other urban areas. Business per=
sonnel face a credible risk of incidental exposure to such attacks. Personn=
el should remain vigilant at all times and (especially in Cali and Medellin=
) may wish to limit their activities in central areas, above all in high-pr=
ofile commercial and entertainment venues which appear to be favored target=
s. (Control Risks, May 29, 2001)

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

-=09Violent protests raise concerns of prolonged unrest

Residents of Licey al Medio on Tuesday, May 29, used strike action and road=
blocks to protest at the jailing of Victor Breton, spokesman for the Broad =
Front for the Popular Struggle (FALPO), and other leaders from the northern=
 town of Naverrete. FALPO threatened to continue protests if the jailed lea=
ders are not released. The protests follow demonstrations in the northern S=
antiago region and renewed violence in the Capotillo suburb of Santo Doming=
o. Deteriorating economic conditions are likely to provoke further protests=
. Recurrent social unrest will raise concerns among foreign businesses oper=
ating in the Dominican Republic and could deter investment. The escalation =
of civil unrest comes as the government hopes to attract foreign investment=
 in the reopening of the Pueblo Viejo goldmine. While unrest is unlikely to=
 delay the project, political and economic instability could deter investor=
s. (Control Risks, May 30, 2001)

Cathay Pacific pilots are scheduled to meet on June 20 to decide on whether=
 to take industrial action from July 1. Strike action in July is likely to =
cause extensive disruption to the busy holiday air traffic. Personnel inten=
ding to fly with the airline should monitor the situation and be prepared t=
o change their flight arrangements. (Control Risks, May 31, 2001)

INDONESIA

-=09Legislators vote to impeach president

Indonesian lawmakers voted on Wednesday, May 30, overwhelmingly to seek a s=
pecial meeting of the Peoples' Consultative Assembly (MPR) that would have =
the power to impeach President Abdurrahman Wahid (Gus Dur). Security forces=
 were on full alert in Gus Dur's East Java stronghold, where thousands of l=
oyalists have clashed with police and vandalized buildings linked to his op=
ponents. Since the most likely date for the MPR to convene is early August,=
 these developments leave the current government in limbo. The most likely =
scenario is that the MPR will vote to impeach the president and install Vic=
e-President Megawati Sukarnoputri as his successor. Frustrated in their att=
empt to stop the legislative vote, the president's supporters are likely to=
 step up the pressure on their political foes by engaging in more violent d=
emonstrations, particularly in East Java. Although major instability is unl=
ikely, foreign personnel should remain vigilant because events may lead to =
an escalation in the security situation at short notice. Jakarta and East J=
ava were tense but calm on May 31 following the impeachment. Protests remai=
n likely in Jakarta and Gus Dur's heartland of Surabaya and other parts of =
East Java over the next few days. Control Risks continues to advise that bu=
siness personnel undertake essential travel only to these areas. (Control R=

ISRAEL

-=09Palestinian extremists "kidnap" later release U.S. and British journali=
sts

A British photographer and an American journalist have been released after =
being detained by Palestinian group calling itself the Fatah Hawks. The pai=
r was held for five hours in south Gaza, along with a local translator and =
driver. The group described the detention as a kidnapping, undertaken to pr=
otest against the British and US governments, who they accuse of supporting=
 the Israeli government, as well against what they claimed was biased weste=
rn media coverage of the Palestinians in their confrontation with the Israe=
lis. The group also warned that other British and American citizens in Pale=
stinian areas might be kidnapped or killed in the future. The official Fata=
h movement has condemned the action and disassociated itself from the incid=
ent. The photographer said he and his colleague, chief of Newsweek's Jerusa=
lem bureau, had arranged an interview with the Fatah Hawks for midday on Ma=
y 29 and after about an hour of talking they were informed they had been ki=
dnapped. "They said the kidnap was largely symbolic," he said. "It was to s=
end a message to Bush and Blair that they held them responsible for the sit=
uation of the Palestinian people and once that message had been broadcast w=
e would be released. Apart from the striking demonstration of ineptness in =
dealing with western media, the incident is also indicative of the growing =
radicalization of the Palestinians and the proliferation of ever more extre=
me splinter groups. Palestinian Administration Chairman Yasser Arafat appea=
rs increasingly unable to control both his own Fatah subordinates and these=
 young extremists effectively and for sustained periods. Arafat has obtaine=
d no concessions from the Israelis who, under Prime Minister Sharon, have a=
lso retracted key territorial concessions for an eventual Palestinian state=
 that had been offered by his predecessor Ehud Barak. Indeed, on May 29 the=
 Israelis announced approval of construction bids for 496 new housing units=
 in settlements outside Jerusalem. (Pinkerton, May 30, 2001)

-=09Bomb placed on major Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway; Netanya again targeted=
 for bombing=20

On Tuesday night, May 29, a road maintenance crew discovered a bomb on the =
major highway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The bomb consisted of a gas c=
anister that was connected to a timing device. The bomb exploded as police =
officers were preparing to dismantle it, using a remote-controlled robot. A=
uthorities had to close the highway temporarily. It was the first time that=
 a bomb had been placed along this highway and the incident represented ano=
ther escalation in the violence related to the Palestinian uprising. On Wed=
nesday, May 30, an explosion occurred in an industrial area located in the =
eastern part of the city of Netanya. Two people were injured in the inciden=
t, which, according to a police official, appeared to be a terrorist attack=
. Netanya is located near the Palestinian-controlled town of Tulqarm and ha=
s witnessed terrorist attacks in the past, most recently on May 18, 2001, w=
hen a suicide bomber set off an explosion outside a shopping mall in the ci=
ty. In two other separate incidents yesterday, Palestinian gunmen killed th=
ree Jewish settlers in ambushes near Nablus, located in the northern part o=
f the West Bank, and near Bethlehem. Both attacks occurred in areas of the =
West Bank designated as Area C, meaning that they are under full Israeli co=
ntrol. Elements on the right of the Israeli political spectrum are putting =
renewed pressure on Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to end the unilateral cease=
-fire he declared last week and retaliate against the Palestinians. Thus fa=
r, however, Sharon has insisted that he will continue to exercise restraint=
. (Air Security, May 30, 2001)

-=09Risk ratings reduced in West Bank, Gaza

Control Risks has reassessed the travel and security risks in the West Bank=
 and Gaza and has reduced the risks from EXTREME to HIGH. Although the conf=
lict between militant Palestinian activists and Israeli military forces con=
tinues and is not expected to end in the foreseeable future, it is confined=
 to certain locations and does not generally affect foreign business person=
nel in the occupied territories. Gun battles generally take place in areas =
near Israeli settlements or roads leading to the settlements, and clashes s=
ometimes take place at Israeli military posts near Palestinian refugee camp=
s. Essential business travel to most Palestinian towns, including Ramallah,=
 Nablus, Jenin and Gaza City, is possible with appropriate planning, includ=
ing co-ordination with contacts inside the towns to ascertain the current s=
ituation at roadblocks and potential flashpoints. (Control Risks, May 29, 2=

-=09Manila imposes news blackout on resort kidnappings

On Tuesday, May 29, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo imposed a news blacko=
ut on Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) operations against Abu Sayyaf G=
roup (ASG) rebels who kidnapped 20 persons, including three Americans, from=
 the Dos Palmas beach resort off Palawan early May 27. She announced the bl=
ackout at her weekly news conference just hours after the ASG threatened a =
mass killing of the hostages if the military launched an assault on its bas=
es in the south. The same day, a spokesman for the US Department of State c=
alled for the unconditional release of all the hostages, including the thre=
e Americans among them. Asked if Washington shared Manila's position of not=
 paying the kidnappers, and promising to use force to free them, the spokes=
man said, "I think everyone is familiar with our policy, which is against p=
aying ransom." (Pinkerton, May 30, 2001)

-=09U.S. State Department Public Announcement

A series of security-related incidents has made travel unsafe in certain ar=
eas of the Philippines. Violence during recent political demonstrations, ki=
dnappings of foreigners, and bombing incidents call for Americans to exerci=
se extreme caution throughout the Philippines. A group of tourists, includi=
ng Americans, were kidnapped from a resort on Palawan Island on May 27 by u=
nknown gunmen using boats. A similar incident was foiled with the loss of s=
everal Filipino lives at a resort on Samal Island, Davao del Norte on May 2=
2, 2001. While no one has claimed responsibility for these incidents, the A=
bu Sayyaf terrorist group (ASG) has taken hostage a number of Filipinos and=
 foreign tourists since April 2000. Some of these hostages were killed by t=
heir captors. In August 2000, the same group took credit for kidnapping a U=
.S. citizen. There is concern that the ASG or other groups may take additio=
nal actions against U.S. citizens and other foreigners. Americans should ex=
ercise great caution when considering travel to resorts on Mindanao and Pal=
awan. Violent political demonstrations on May 1 in the Malacanang area of M=
anila reportedly left two police officers and several protesters dead. Alth=
ough the violence has been brought under control, the possibility exists of=
 further such demonstrations. In late December 2000, a series of bombs expl=
oded in the Metro Manila area, including the cargo terminal at Ninoy Aquino=
 International Airport (NAIA), on December 30, 2000, killing 18 people and =
injuring 100. There have also been sporadic incidents of violence in southe=
rn Mindanao, including bombings in General Santos City and at the Cotabato =
Airport in Maguindanao Province, as well as bus hijackings on national high=
ways. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front reportedly has claimed responsibili=
ty for these actions. U.S. citizens are strongly cautioned to avoid all tra=
vel to the southern and western areas of the Island of Mindanao, to include=
 Zamboanga City, due to incidents of terrorism and violence. U.S. citizens =
should avoid travel to the islands of Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Jolo lo=
cated in the Sulu archipelago in the extreme southwest of the Philippines. =
American citizens should exercise great caution when considering travel to =
resorts in other parts of Mindanao as well as Palawan. For other informatio=
n on terrorist activities in this region, refer to the Department of State'=
s Public Announcement on Malaysia dated April 9, 2001. In view of these inc=
idents, and the possibility of future attacks, Americans are also urged to =
be particularly cautious in outdoor public areas and not approach or linger=
 in the vicinity of a bomb-related incident. Americans are cautioned not to=
 disturb suspicious objects or packages and should report any incidents to =

-=09Security, business revival foreseen in Johannesburg Central Business Di=
strict

Gauteng Province Finance and Economic Affairs representative Jabu Moleketi =
on Tuesday, May 29, forecast that within three years Johannesburg's Central=
 Business District (CBD) would experience a boom in business and property v=
alues. The city's business and security community cautiously endorses the p=
rovincial government's optimistic forecast, which reflects a gradual decrea=
se in crime levels in the CBD. Control Risks continues to advise that where=
 possible businesses should focus their operations in, and travelers should=
 stay in hotels in, the safer northern suburbs such as Sandton. However, th=
e gradual reduction in the incidence of crime in the CBD, lower property pr=
ices and problems with logistics and traffic circulation in the northern su=
burbs means that a revival in business interest in central property is like=
ly to take place gradually. (Control Risks, May 30, 2001)

SWEDEN

The city of Gothenburg in western Sweden will host two major international =
summit meetings June 14 -16. Local authorities estimate that at least ten t=

the city, including some well-known tourist sites, will be closed to the ge=
neral public. Travelers to Gothenburg may also experience delays due to res=
tricted traffic movement through certain areas. U.S. citizens should exerci=

TAJIKISTAN

-=09US embassy reissues warning against travel

The US on Wednesday, May 30, renewed its warning that US citizens should no=
t travel to Tajikistan in the face of a possible attack from Islamic milita=
nts. The warning underlines Control Risks long-standing advice about the ri=
sks of travel to Tajikistan. Fighters for the Islamic Movement of Uzbekista=
n (IMU) are currently preparing for annual summer attacks into Uzbekistan a=
nd Kyrygzstan as mountain passes clear. Hence, Control Risks has raised the=
 security and travel risks in Tavildera district in central Tajikistan, whe=
re the IMU is currently based, and the border areas with Kyrgyzstan to EXTR=
EME from HIGH. The Garm district, where the IMU has long been based, and th=
e Afghan border are also at EXTREME security and travel risk. Control Risks=
 continues to advise against travel to these areas during the coming months=
. (Control Risks, May 30, 2001)

-=09U.S. State Department Travel Warning

The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to defer all travel to Tajikist=
an. Due to threats to Americans and American interests worldwide, instabili=
ty in Tajikistan, and the limited ability to secure the safety of embassy p=
ersonnel at the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe in their current facility, the Dep=
artment of State suspended Embassy operations there and temporarily relocat=
ed all American diplomatic personnel to Almaty, Kazakhstan in September 199=
8. Although the political climate has improved, the situation remains unpre=
dictable. During the summer periods of 1999 and 2000, Tajikistan experience=
d incursions of armed militants loyal to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan=
 (IMU), which the Secretary of State has designated as a foreign terrorist =
organization. In both years, IMU forces took foreigners hostage. There have=
 been reports indicating an incursion by the IMU into Tajikistan may occur =
again this year. Americans should in particular avoid areas along the borde=
rs with Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan, the Karategin Valley, and Tavildara Dis=
trict. The "suspended operations" status of the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe ha=
s been lifted, with U.S. Embassy American personnel currently residing in A=
lmaty, Kazakhstan traveling periodically to Tajikistan. Consular services f=
or Tajikistan are handled in coordination with the U.S. Embassy in Almaty a=
nd emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Tajikistan may be limite=
d or unavailable. American citizens resident in Tajikistan are urged to con=
sider their personal security and safety in view of this warning. For furth=
er information concerning travel to Tajikistan consult the latest Consular =
Information Sheet for Tajikistan, available on the World Wide Web at http:/=
/travel.state.gov. This Travel Warning replaces the Travel Warning for Taji=
kistan issued August 30, 2000, to update the security situation. (U.S. Stat=

VENEZUELA

-=09Coup rumors circulating freely

An anonymous ad in the conservative Washington Times on Thursday, May 24, h=
as stimulated new rumors of a military coup d'etat against populist Preside=
nt Hugo Chavez. The ad said that a "National Emergency Junta" was seeking C=
havez's immediate resignation. It accused Chavez of being responsible for t=
he high level of insecurity in the country, for the economic crisis, for ma=
king military personnel work on civilian projects, for corruption, and for =
supporting a covert Cuban communist intervention in the country. Since the =
ad rumors of military plots have circulated so widely that Chavez, currentl=
y on a visit to China, felt he had to address the country to denounce the r=
umors. His Minister of Defense, widely unpopular with the military, said th=
e government knew who was trying to destabilize the country, charging that =
the plotters were counting on US government support, but he knew that Washi=
ngton would never support a coup because it was not interested in "adventur=
es" of this type. Local analysts state that there is clearly considerable a=
nti-Chavez sentiment among various levels of the military and the upper cla=
sses. Moreover, Chavez's recent talk of declaring a state of emergency, whi=
ch would give him even greater powers, has provided additional ammunition t=
o anyone disposed to a military takeover. However, one can safely presume t=
hat Washington, despite its differences with Chavez, would not support any =
effort to overthrow Venezuela's democratically elected president. (Pinkerto=

WORLDWIDE CAUTION=20

-=09U.S. State Department Public Announcement

The U.S. Government learned in early May 2001 that American citizens abroad=
 might be the target of a terrorist threat from extremist groups with links=
 to Usama Bin Ladin's Al-Qaida organization. In the past, such individuals =
have not distinguished between official and civilian targets. As always, we=
 take this information seriously. U.S. Government facilities worldwide rema=
in at a heightened state of alert. On May 29, the defendants in the case of=
 U.S. v. Bin Ladin were found guilty on a number of counts in connection wi=
th the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar Es Salaam, =
Tanzania. The U.S. Government is not aware of any specific threat in respon=
se to the verdicts. Nevertheless, U.S. citizens are urged to maintain a hig=
h level of vigilance and to take appropriate steps to increase their securi=
ty awareness to reduce their vulnerability. Americans should maintain a low=
 profile, vary routes and times for all required travel, and treat mail and=
 packages from unfamiliar sources with suspicion. In addition, American cit=
izens are also urged to avoid contact with any suspicious, unfamiliar objec=
ts, and to report the presence of the objects to local authorities. Vehicle=
s should not be left unattended, if at all possible, and should be kept loc=
ked at all times. U.S. Government personnel overseas have been advised to t=
ake the same precautions. In addition, U.S. Government facilities have and =
will continue to temporarily close or suspend public services as necessary =
to review their security posture and ensure its adequacy. U.S. citizens pla=
nning to travel abroad should consult the Department of State's Public Anno=
uncements, Travel Warnings, Consular Information Sheets, and regional trave=
l brochures, all of which are available at the Consular Affairs Internet we=
b site at http://travel.state.gov. We will continue to provide updated info=
rmation should it become available. American citizens overseas may contact =
the American Citizens Services unit of the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulat=
e by telephone or fax for up-to-date information on security conditions. In=
 addition, American citizens in need of emergency assistance should telepho=
ne the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate before visiting the Embassy or Con=
sulate. This Public Announcement supersedes the Public Announcement - World=
wide Caution of May 11, 2001 to inform Americans of the verdict in U.S. v. =
Bin Ladin. This Public Announcement expires on August 29, 2001. (U.S. State=

WORLDWIDE TERRORIST THREATS

-=09Embassy bombing convictions unlikely to lead to retaliation against bus=
iness targets

A New York (US) jury on Tuesday, May 29, found four men guilty of conspirin=
g with Saudi-born Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden to bomb the US embassie=
s in Nairobi (Kenya) and Dar es-Salaam (Tanzania) in 1998. Although all fou=
r face life in prison without parole, two defendants may face the death pen=
alty. Islamic extremist groups associated with bin Laden may plan retaliato=
ry attacks in response to the verdicts. Should the two receive the death pe=
nalty, their date of execution would provide a date around which attacks mi=
ght be expected. The bin Laden networks focus on US and British military, d=
iplomatic and defense company targets. Those facilities and personnel in th=
e Arabian peninsula have faced a MEDIUM security risk since October 2000. H=
owever, the networks are unlikely to target business interests in retaliati=
on. Tourist targets are also unlikely to be targeted, with the exception of=
 tourist sites in Jordan. (Control Risks, May 30, 2001)

ZIMBABWE

-=09Departing travelers face currency confiscation

The commissioner of the Zimbabwe Department of Customs and Excise Ranga Mun=
yaradzi conceded on Wednesday, May 30, that a large amount of foreign curre=
ncy has been seized from travelers leaving the country at both Harare inter=
national airport and the Beitbridge land border crossing. A rarely publiciz=
ed law relating to maximum cash removal is being enforced against all indiv=
iduals attempting to depart with sums of cash in excess of $500 or its equi=

Wade,

I know how crazy busy it has been in the last couple of days.  The team has refined certain of the numbers and inserted the contents of the slides that were missing last week.  I wanted you to have an updated version of our work product to date, for review/comment at your convenience.   

Hope this is helpful.

Subject:	RE: Supervisory Board Meeting on 2001-11-20

I believe that the Resolutions No. 4, 6 and 9 are not correct in terms of the text:

1. resolution no. 4 is not correct since the S.Board did not review the new (attached) changes to the budget and did not approve it. There was also an amandement to the text of the Resolution re. the line items and the total amounts exeeding the approved budget.	

I believe that the draft Budget with the new amendemends must be reviewed once again as a whole at the next Sup.Board meeting before it can be enacted.

2. Resoltuions No. 6 and 9 - the vote descritpion is not correct

Regards - Jarek

Personal & Confidential

Marc:

Given your message to me the other night, as well as recent communications between your commercial personnel and our credit group, I want to again review the NPW disclosure issues with you, Scott Freeman/Joe Armbrust and Joe Cialone.

I believe that it is essential that we discuss the disclosure issues today, and will be traveling tomorrow.  Please let me know this afternoon when we might be able to talk.

Thanks,
Robert

Rex -- I don't normally pitch for my old firm, but GD&C has a pretty good group of SEC enforcement folks in their D.C. office and one of my former partners called asking if there would be any opportunity for them to assist in any way.  They understand that Enron has already retained counsel but are interested in any related representation of officers, directors, affiliates, etc.

I told them that I didn't think there was likely to be any opportunity for them at this point, but at Rob's suggestion I thought I would check with you to see if it would be useful for them to contact you.  

Hope things go well for us and that we can put this behind us and move on as quickly as possible.

Regards,
	John

Subject:=09Friday Renegotiation Committee meeting and other events

Here is overview of day. I've tried to summarize most of what happened.

Mohan and I met early in morning with the lenders' observers to the meeting=
, Mr. Kharkanis and Abhay Ahuja. Both are attorneys who work for the same l=
awfirm, India Legal Advisors (previously affiliated with White & Case). Thi=
s firm has represented Dabhol lenders in the past. Mr. Kharkanis is former =
chief legal counsel at IDBI. Very pleasant meeting. Three points they made =
-- (a) very difficult to resolve unless someone is willing to take all the =
power, (b) this committee is probably not a proper committee to be renegoti=
ating with as it is comprised of all Review Committee members, who are alre=
ady biased in their conclusions, and (c) they asked about the misdeclaratio=
n issue. I told them we felt we had a strong case and were willing to go al=
l the way in arbitration or, assuming a big picture renegotiation could wor=
k, resolve it in context of that renegotiation. But I pointed out a renegot=
iation, while possible, was going to be difficult, and it would be an absol=
ute non-starter unless GOI stood up and said they could take power.

At Renegotiation Committee (RC) meeting, only 3 of 9 members from their sid=
e were present. Dr. Godbole, chair; Mr. Lal, Energy Secretary; and Ms. Bans=
al, MSEB chair. Notably absent was any GOI representative. Their offered ra=
tionale for this absence was that Mr. Gaukak (not Mr. Harish Salve as earli=
er reported) had been appointed only last night and could not make it. It i=
s clear to me that (a) GOI is still taking a hands-off approach and they de=
layed appointment until late enough so they could not make meeting, and (b)=
 GOI's commitment to finding workable solution is in question as they don't=
 seem to be giving this any type of serious consideration based on who they=
 appoint (Mr. Gaukak is former secretary in Telecom Dept.).

The press was allowed in at the beginning of the meeting only to take photo=
s. They left and the meeting began. We agreed after the meeting that neithe=
r party would discuss with the press about the meeting. As we left, we were=
 absolutely mobbed and we "no commented" our way through the mob and left. =
The mob was quite large and the walking space was small and going downstair=
s, so there were a couple of reporters who tripped and fell and dropped cam=
eras. Hopefully, the headlines will not read "Enron stomps Journalist."

The meeting lasted almost 2 hours. The RC opened up by saying their positio=
n was on the table through the Godbole Committee Report and wanted us to re=
spond. I read from my prepared notes, and told them we were open minded, wi=
lling to listen but we had serious constraints. My key points from my notes=
 were (a) who was going to buy the power from this 2184MW baseload plant th=
at had to operate at high PLF for it to be economical, (b) our project was =
out of money and would probably have to shut down absent further funding fr=
om lenders, which depended on favorable gov't response to lender letter (th=
is did not seem to bother them at all), (c) the main problem was their fail=
ure I told them I felt it was major issue that GOI was not present and not =
engaging in this dialogue. I said the absence of GOI meant that very little=
 would be accomplished today as the key to any solution involved GOI involv=
ement, and we needed to know what GOI's position was. The RC responded by s=
aying they were disappointed that we did not have representatives from shar=
eholders, lenders (and they objected here to the lenders' observer role ver=
sus an active participant role), fuel suppliers and others here and they di=
d not know whether to interpret that as lack of seriousness/commitment or n=
ot.

The most disturbing thing to me was the Dr. Godbole was very clear, to the =
point of stating this and repeating it again, that the original project was=
 a mistake and DPC should pay for that mistake. He said that DPC proposed a=
 2000 MW LNG facility with high PLF, and thus now that such a project is no=
t working, it is DPC's fault (his rationale being that without DPC proposin=
g the idea originally, it never would have come about) and we should pay. W=
hen I asked him what tariff he thought should be appropriate, he quoted fro=
m the Godbole Committee report -- the lowest tariff available to any gas-ba=
sed plant in the country, with no ToP. Since the whole LNG idea was DPC's, =
we should bear 100% of any LNG costs except for a reasonable per MMbtu pric=
e that MSEB would pay as if they had a natural gas pipeline running already=
 in place and running by their plant. Yes, folks, it was that ludicrous.

It's clear that among the 3 people there, Dr. Godbole was the firmest in hi=
s extreme positions. And he is firm in those positions. Mr. Lal and Mr. Ban=
sal were more conciliatory and trying to find some middle ground, although =
since they only represent MSEB/GOM, their ability to do this is limited to =
only one power block, and even on that, they are looking for tariff relief =
and ToP relief beyond our ability to handle. But they are trying to move to=
 the middle, whereas the chairman is not.

Even in absence of GOI, we talked at length about the fact that they had to=
 play a role. The RC said they were not sure if GOI was willing to play a r=
ole other than counter-guarantor, and even if they were, the GOI could not =
be expected to pay more than a "market" price -- whatever a SEB in India is=
 willing to pay. Currently, that ranges around Rs. 2.50. It is clear that D=
r. Godbole feels no responsibility whatsoever for 2 power blocks, and he th=
inks DPC should take responsibility, including convincing GOI to buy some a=
mount of this at the "market" price. On this market price issue, I made it =
clear that it was not our problem that the market price in India was an unr=
ealistically low price influenced by subsidies, lack of tariff rationalizat=
ion, etc. and we would not be able to meet their demands. We discussed the =
need for having a creditworthy buyer for power from DPC at 90% PLF, before =
we could talk any tariff relief, and even then, tariff relief expectations =
had to be reasonable (not the 30% they are asking for but less than 10%).=
=20

LNG terminal separation from power plant: They asked if an LNG terminal spl=
it was possible, and we asked what did they think that would get them. They=
 said tariff relief and absence of ToP. We pointed out tariff relief had be=
en given in 1995 renegotiations when LNG terminal had been originally split=
, and even when the terminal was included added back, the tariff relief had=
 remained to MSEB's favor. We stated that the ToP would remain with the ult=
imate customer, even if the terminal was split. They said why should the po=
wer plant pay for all excess capacity in LNG terminal and we reminded them =
again that the LNG terminal capacity was built solely for the power station=
 as MSEB had required, and that 2 separate independent consultants had conf=
irmed this.

RC asked for various proposals on what our tariff would be at various PLFs,=
 assuming a certain reduced % tariff. We told them that since the project o=
nly made sense at a high (90%) PLF, the key was for them and GOI to identif=
y buyers for 90%, and then tariff is known.

Conclusion: they wanted to meet again and have a further discussion. We agr=
eed to meet on May 23, but agreed that in interim, we had to know what the =
role of the GOI was. We agreed that we would both go back and think about w=
hat had been said and see if solutions were there, but we said that key was=
 where were the buyers for this power.

Subject:=09Renegotiation thoughts

Below is an e-mail I worked up on my renegotiation thoughts for your readin=
g pleasure. Since this idea came up on our Thursday call, I will go ahead a=
nd send the e-mail out for feedback. We can discuss any thoughts you have o=
n this either Friday or on a subsequent call.

Regards,
Col. Travis

_____________________________________

The thoughts below are not for our meeting on Friday, but they represent so=
mething that I think we need to be prepared for at some point after Friday.=
 I ask your patience in presenting some thoughts on a possible renegotiatio=
n strategy.

Background:

We are going down a termination path, which we are willing to go all the wa=
y on. We also are aiming for a buyout option at some point.=20

Lenders are concerned about the path, as we all are, and are taking some ti=
me to get comfortable with the steps. This has led to a delay in approval f=
or PTN and perhaps a delayed approval after PTN for a Transfer Notice. Whil=
e the lenders may know the ultimate resolution is a termination or buyout, =
the lenders are concerned that DPC has not done all in its power to find an=
 amicable solution through negotiation. Given hundreds of published comment=
s, the Godbole Committee report, our understanding of GOM finances, politic=
al party differences, weak coalition gov'ts, etc., we know that renegotiati=
on is going to be almost impossible. But the lenders are not there yet, and=
 in this period, we don't want to lose the lenders completely. We need lend=
ers and their approval for a buyout, as well as a termination. Plus we don'=
t want to upset lenders completely to a point they ask "what value is DPC (=
Enron/GE/Bechtel) bringing to the project?" and thus decide to cut the equi=
ty out and to seek some other solution without the current equity.=20

Government parties (MSEB, GOM, GOI) are concerned about this path as they d=
on't fully appreciate what it means for them or DPC. In addition, this hard=
ball tactic is not their normal style, although they are capable of being f=
airly rough when they get pinned down. This is especially true since our as=
sets and people are on their home turf. The hardball, while we are used to =
it and believe it is the proper strategy, is leading to hardening of positi=
ons by government, and will make subsequent discussions (whether on transfe=
r amount, buyout option or any renegotiation) more difficult. We also shoul=
d be thinking of keeping doors open, if only a slight bit, with government,=
 as we will need some level of cooperation for buyout, transfer amount or a=
ny renegotiation.

I think we should develop a renegotiation option that is a combination of t=
hings. First, something that if our plans go out of control, we have someth=
ing we can fallback on as a last option. While renegotiation and the conseq=
uent reduction in equity returns might be an unattractive option, I think w=
e can make it more attractive than it currently is, as you can see from the=
 list below. This provides some "face-saving" option for the government, if=
 they choose to go this route. Second, it is something that shows the lende=
rs (who we have to care about) and the government (who we care less about, =
but still care somewhat due to need for their approvals and cooperation) th=
at we are not slamming the door shut on any further discussions. Third, it =
is something that will be very difficult for the government and perhaps the=
 lenders, fuel supplier and shipowners to agree to, and thus we will probab=
ly get to the goal of termination regardless.

Right now, the lenders are our immediate hurdle with the challenge of getti=
ng them over the hump of a quick PTN and a simultaneous or shortly thereaft=
er Transfer Notice. So I would recommend we discuss the plan below internal=
ly and modify it as needed. Before we would show it to anyone, we would dec=
ide what is our minimum (I propose the attached be our minimum) and we will=
 beef it up as needed. If required, we will have it ready to show to lender=
s at an appropriate time, or to have a senior Enron executive such as Ken o=
r Rebecca or a Houston-approved emissary get it to GOI. We would say this i=
s what we are willing to do to avoid final termination (we still will proce=
ed with PTN and Transfer Notice, as soon as lender consent obtained), but g=
overnment and other counterparties must agree to obligations contained in t=
he list. This shows the lenders that we are willing to at least play the re=
negotiation game.=20

Here's the Dabhol Wishlist in short bulletpoints. These need work and furth=
er scrubbing, but before spending significant time on this, I want to get i=
nput from management if this is something they would want us to explore. Ag=
ain, I think these are our minimum, worst case things, so we could beef it =
up accordingly.

1. Dabhol agrees to not terminate project. [In light of recent events and h=
igh level concerns meetings being held in Maharashtra and Delhi, we should =
not understimate the value this concession provides to GOI and GOM.]

2. Dabhol agrees to tariff reduction from ECS of Phase II on LNG of 50 pais=
e for 1st 10 years, up to Rs. 1.00 for the remaining 10 years. This is done=
 primarily through a debt reschedulement, granting liquidity relief in firs=
t 3 years to MSEB and recovery through GOM bonds, and ROE reduction by conv=
erting to 2 part tariff. Equity reduction by eliminating MSEB's equity in p=
roject.=20

3. GOI agrees to backstop (purchase or credit support) 2 power blocks and G=
OM/MSEB takes one.  [Note: I think we should ask for GOI to backstop all 3,=
 but I think 2 is the most possible.]

4. GOI or GOM or Indian Financial Institutions (IFIs) (or combination there=
of) takes enough equity at par to reduce Enron to 50%.

5. All additional funding requirements for the project, including additiona=
l funds for development cost recovery, cost overruns for capital costs, wor=
king capital, customs, commissioning fuel, etc. to be funded by additional =
loans or equity to DPC from IFIs. This also includes any cost overruns due =
to construction stoppage and delay we are currently facing. We should even =
ask to eliminate existing Phase II sponsor Project Completion Support and r=
eplace it with IFI loans. That last point may be a bit much since we have a=
lready committed to this, but if the option is that we will walk from this =
project, the IFIs with appropriate pressure from government could support t=
his.

6. Negotiate to eliminate liquidity L/C obligation, LNG Supply L/C obligati=
on and ship L/C obligation. If funding support is needed to cover these sho=
rtfalls, it will come from IFIs.

Recall that this project has significant cashflow in later years, and the I=
FI debt raised in #5 and 6 above could be repaid during that time.

7. All equity hold restrictions on Enron, GE and Bechtel are lifted, includ=
ed those in project documents (for example, GOI guarantee and PPA) and loan=
 documents. Enron's internal plans would be to exit after deal signed up.

8. MSEB to drop existing misdeclaration claims, and take steps in PPA to en=
sure this is not an issue going forward.=20

There are many other items that can be included, including approvals from R=
BI to recover all sponsors development costs, which would be funded by IFIs=
 under #5 above, fuel hedging ability for MSEB, clearances for Metgas to ma=
ximize value we can get in sale of the Metgas TARA, etc. Alternatively, we =
could give Metgas contractual rights and existing permits and contracts to =
GOI in exchange for their agreeing to items above. However, I wanted to foc=
us on the bigger picture and have a discussion with management first on the=
 concept before we put the extensive list together.

I know it's a wish list, but if parties (government, IFIs, other counterpar=
ties) do not want this deal to terminate and equity to pull out and if they=
 agree to points above, the sponsors would get the project done with limite=
d additional funding by sponsors. This could be only transactional costs as=
sociated with restructuring, which while significant, do not approach cost =
of going forward as is. And it may include existing $233MM Project Completi=
on Support, although we would negotiate hard to replace that with IFI debt =
or equity.

We should still continue down PTN and Transfer Notice path, but we should a=
lso consider how we give lenders and gov't some indication that we are stil=

Jim:  Please see the attached.  This was my attempt to get a more appropriate signatory to some of these financial statements that you have been inundated with.  With respect to EBS Belgium, as a practical matter I don't think we can expect to get employees who are no longer with the Company (Ken Rice, Steve Elliott)  to sign; indeed, I will try to find out why they are still on the list.  We'll keep trying to find other, more appropriate folks to address these matters, but my guess is that you will continue to receive some of these for awhile.  Rex

I do regret the time required for this.  Unfortunately the requirements of the Belgian tax authorities are that a director is required to this return.  They have Mr Derrick, Mr Rice and Mr  Steve Elliot listed as directors.  I was given to understand that Mr Elliot had left the company but found him on the Houston Intranet - would you prefer it if I approached him (or Mr Rice) for these returns?

With respect to the earlier return for EBS Italy, the Italian authorities require the Chairman of the Board of Directors to sign the tax return - which was Mr Derrick

Dont hesitate to let me know if you would like me to redirect my request to Mr Rice or Mr Elliot

Regards, Harveen

Thank you.  We will be expecting the documents.  As you know, Mr. Derrick has no direct involvement with EBS Belgium, and accordingly, must spend a significant amount of time and due diligence before signing these types of documents.  He wanted me to ensure him that there was not another more appropriate party to sign these documents (someone who is more directly involved with this company's activities and financial statements).  I assume there is no one else who can sign, but could you kindly confirm that for me?  Thanks you.  Regards, Rex Rogers

Sir, I am placing in tonight's (courier) post, for your attention, a Corporate Tax Return package containing

	- a cover letter to the Tax Audit office
	- corporate income tax return form 275.1 
	- investment deduction form 276.U

for the period ended 31 December 2000.  I have also enclosed English translations of the letter and the first return and the basis of the calculation for the tax incentive (investment deduction)

I would be grateful if you could clear the returns so that they can presented to Mr Derrick for his signature.  The papers have already been initialled by Jas Somrah, the tax manager responsible for EBS Europe.  The authorities have agreed to a further extension of the filing date of 9 November 

I have further back up such as the annual accounts - please let me know if you need anything else and I can fax it to you. 

With thanks, Harveen

DASCHLE SAYS YUCCA MOUNTAIN NUCLEAR WASTE REPOSITORY IS DEAD
ISSUE

Incoming Senate Majority Leader Daschle says his party will
block the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository
in Nevada. "I think the Yucca Mountain issue is dead,"
Daschle tells reporters in Las Vegas, where he went to
attend a fundraiser for Senate Majority Whip Reid. Reid
opposes efforts to expedite construction of the Yucca
Mountain facility, which would hold waste from nuclear power
plants. . . . Page AA-1

GROUPS CALL FOR EPA MORATORIUM ON OPEN MARKET EMISSIONS
TRADING

A coalition of 20 environmental groups writes EPA
Administrator Whitman asking her to impose a moratorium on
state "open market" emissions trading programs.  The groups
say the trading programs are unenforceable and impose
disproportionate impacts on minority and poor communities.
"Rather than balancing incentives with enforcement, these
programs simply concede enforcement to market participants,"
the letter states. . . . Page A-2

SCIENCE ADVISERS ISSUE FINAL REVIEW OF EPA'S REASSESSMENT OF
DIOXINS

A final report assessing the science EPA used to examine the
risks of dioxins is released by EPA's Science Advisory
Board, allowing EPA to complete its dioxins reassessment.
The reassessment, which has taken more than a decade to
complete, will be used by any EPA office regulating dioxins.
For example, the reassessment is expected to affect a
proposed rule EPA issued setting limits of dioxins in sewage
sludge applied to land. . . . Page A-1

DOT SAYS FEDERAL HAZMAT TRANSPORT RULES PREEMPT CLEVELAND
ORDINANCES

Three local ordinances that regulate the transportation of
hazardous materials in Cleveland are struck down in a
Department of Transportation ruling. The Cleveland
ordinances for hazardous material shipment routings,
shipment notifications, and police escort requirements are
preempted under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.

INTERIOR DEPARTMENT ADVISORY PANEL PROPOSES STUDY OF NEW
OFFSHORE DRILLING

An advisory committee will recommend that Interior Secretary
Norton consider opening certain Outer Continental Shelf
areas for oil and gas drilling in a report expected to be
released this week. The panel will not identify any specific
areas that should be opened to oil and gas exploration, but
instead will ask the Interior Department to make identifying
such areas a priority. . . . Page A-9

141 PARTIES TO PAY $668,695 FOR CLEANUP COSTS AT COLORADO
SUPERFUND SITE

EPA and 141 parties that contributed small amounts of
hazardous substances to a Colorado superfund site reach an
agreement requiring the parties to pay a total of $668,695,
according to a notice to be published today. Under the
proposed administrative settlement, 137 private companies
and four federal facilities resolve their liability for past

SOY INGREDIENT SAID TO CAUSE CANCER IN MICE EXPOSED DURING
INFANCY

A natural ingredient found in soy caused uterine cancer in
mice exposed during their infancy, according to a study
scheduled to appear in "Cancer Research". The study found
that organisms exposed during key periods of development to
chemicals that affect hormones may be harmed, says Retha
Newbold, the study's principal investigator. The question of
when to expose organisms to ensure that the adverse effects
of pesticides, industrial chemicals, and compounds in
drinking water are detected is a key issue in a screening
and testing program EPA is developing. . . . Page A-3

EPA SEEKS RECOMMENDATIONS ON COORDINATING PESTICIDE, WATER
LAWS

EPA asks its regional offices for recommendations on
coordinating the requirements of pesticide and water laws.
In a memo to regional offices, Stephen Johnson, the acting
assistant administrator responsible for pesticides, and
Diane Regas, acting assistant administrator for water, say
EPA does not have a national policy on how the Clean Water
Act would apply to pesticide applications. . . . Page A-6

DOT OUTLINES IDEAS FOR FASTER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS OF
AIRPORT PROJECTS

Establishing environmental impact statement teams for major
airport runway projects, increasing the number of federal
environmental specialists, and improving interagency
coordination could speed reviews and reduce air travel
delays, according to a Department of Transportation report
to Congress. The Federal Aviation Administration says an
environmental impact statement for a major new runway
currently takes between three and three and one half years
on average to complete. . . . Page A-5

U.K. AGENCY WARNS MILK DRINKERS OF CONTAMINATION FROM ANIMAL
DISPOSAL

Massive bonfires in the United Kingdom for disposal of
cattle in the wake of the recent foot and mouth disease
epidemic may be releasing dioxins into the air,
contaminating surrounding pastures and infecting dairy
animals grazing in the immediate vicinity, the UK's Food
Standards Agency warns. The advisory warning is aimed at
consumers of whole milk, diary farmers, and sheep and goat
farmers who produce milk. . . . Page A-3

improvements, according to recommendations from a government
commission. The commission says fundamental reforms are
needed to address, among other things, nitrate, phosphate,
and ammonia pollution associated with raising livestock. . .

j-i've seen several articles recently re enron and india and have thought of
you. in some ways it's hard to realize that one of us is involved in a
matter of such great significance in the affairs of a major world power.
what would jim roach think. i hope that all continues well with you and your
family. it's hard, i know, when work and travel are so demanding; but as we
have discussed on numerous occasions there is no substitute for family and
friends. i've little to report in the way of any interesting reading
recently; i've been spending time on books relating to bioethics and spanish
literature[actually, il've taken a liking to spanish mysteries; although
i've run out of our friend perez-reverte and am getting involved in some
suggested by my spanish teacher]. deborah and i are immersing ourselves in a
serious summer program of hiking and gardening and just enjoying our time
together; it's a great feeling to have lived with someone for 30+ years and
discover new and wonderful things.  hopefully you'll find occasion to share
a hike with us this
summer.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

HIGHLIGHTS

JEFFORDS, LIEBERMAN URGE SPEEDY IMPLEMENTATION OF NITROGEN
OXIDES RULE

Sens. Jeffords and Lieberman write EPA Administrator Whitman
to urge speedy implementation of a rule to control nitrogen
oxide emissions that affect the Northeast. The senators say
the rule's reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions "will
deliver tremendous public health and environmental
benefits." Their letter follows a federal appeals court
ruling upholding the EPA rule requiring power plants and
other large industrial air pollution sources in the Midwest
and Southeast to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. . . . Page
A-1

JEFFORDS TO LEAD SENATE ENVIRONMENT PANEL, FAVORS NEW
POLLUTION CONTROLS

Sen. Jeffords will chair the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee. Among the environmental issues of interest
to Jeffords are stricter controls on air pollution from
utilities. He introduced a bill in March (S. 556) to
regulate emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides,
carbon dioxide, and mercury from electric utilities. . . .

BUSH EXPECTED TO EMPHASIZE ENVIRONMENT IN SPEECH NEXT WEEK
IN FLORIDA

Following a call for improved maintenance of national parks,
President Bush is expected to emphasize other environmental
proposals at a speech in the Florida Everglades next week.
Speaking at Sequoia National Park, Bush announces a National
Parks Legacy Project, seeking to eliminate a maintenance
backlog in the national parks system over the next five
years. Bush also uses his remarks at Sequoia to cite
environmental progress made in recent decades. . . . Page

MOTOROLA WINS JURY VERDICT IN LAWSUIT OVER TRICHLOROETHYLENE
CONTAMINATION

An Arizona Superior Court jury returns a verdict in favor of
Motorola Inc., in a decade-long, class-action lawsuit
concerning the company's dumping of trichloroethylene at its
Scottsdale facility. The ruling means Motorola will not have
to pay damages to about 20,000 homeowners and business
owners located near the facility. Plaintiffs in the case had
argued that the dumping of the trichloroethylene and
subsequent contamination of ground water in a six- to
eight-square-mile plume lowered property values. . . . Page

ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS MAY RUSH WETLANDS PERMITS FOR ENERGY
PROJECTS

With the Bush administration focusing on increased energy
production, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is bracing for
the onslaught of permit applications associated with
drilling and power plant construction. The chief of the
regulatory branch of the corps, which issues Clean Water Act
permits for activities that disturb wetlands, says his
office will try to expedite the permit process for the
construction of power plants. . . . Page A-9

INDUSTRY SEEKS PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR ENERGY, POLLUTION CONTROL
INNOVATIONS

Developers of innovative environmental technologies urge the
federal government to toughen energy efficiency standards,
expand incentives for innovations, and make regulations more
flexible. Testifying at a field hearing of the Senate
Environment Committee in New Hampshire, industry executives
describe how their firms are developing fuel cell
technology, power plant pollution controls, and ocean wave
and solar power. . . . Page A-2

NEARLY HALF OF STORAGE TANK TRUST FUND SPENT ON
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Nearly half of the funds from the Leaking Underground
Storage Tanks Trust Fund used by states to clean up leaks
went to administrative expenses for the first half of fiscal
2001, according to a semiannual government report. EPA's
report reveals that 43 percent of the trust fund's money
spent by states during the first half of the year went to
administrative needs. . . . Page A-9

EPA ADVISORY PANEL ON ARSENIC EXAMINES TWO ESTIMATES OF COST
OF RULE

An EPA advisory panel ends the first round of meetings to
review the costs of tightening the arsenic standard in
drinking water by listing differences between the EPA
estimate and the higher cost estimates from the American
Water Works Association. The review, along with a
corresponding National Academy of Sciences study of health
benefits, was ordered by EPA Administrator Whitman after the
Bush administration suspended a new arsenic standard issued
during the closing days of the Clinton administration. . . .

STRONGER AUDITING SAID NEEDED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
SYSTEMS

Businesses and public agencies seeking accreditation and
registration of their environmental management systems
should consider strengthening auditor requirements and
certifying auditors and consultants, according to a report
prepared for EPA. The report, written by a panel of the
National Academy of Public Administration, is intended to
promote understanding of how the International Standards
Organization's "ISO 14001" accreditation, registration, and
auditing system works in the United States and to identify
areas where it needs to be strengthened. . . . Page A-4

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4g1g2m6_


CONGRESS, EPA URGED TO INCREASE SHARE OF AGENCY FUNDS USED
FOR RESEARCH

A federal advisory committee wants Congress and EPA to
increase the share of the agency's budget that goes for
research. The Science Advisory Board says the current
9-percent share of EPA's funding used for research should
grow to a 12-percent share of the agency's budget. . . .

BUSH TO NOMINATE TRANSPORTATION EXECUTIVE FOR DOT HAZMAT
POST

The White House announces President Bush's intention to
nominate Ellen G. Engleman, an executive with an alternative
transport research group, to be administrator of the
Department of Transportation's Research and Special Programs
Administration. RSPA is responsible for hazardous materials
regulation and pipeline safety. . . . Page A-8

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4g2m9n7_


SUPERFUND BILL WOULD REQUIRE FEDERAL COMPLIANCE WITH STATE,
LOCAL RULES

Legislation (H.R. 2016) that would ensure the federal
government's compliance with federal, state, and local
hazardous waste laws is introduced in the House by Rep.
DeGette. The bill would amend the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act to
subject federal facilities and agencies to all federal,
state, interstate, and local requirements regarding response
or restoration actions taken after releases of hazardous
substances, according to the legislation. . . . Page A-7

proposes an environmental court to handle a broad array of
cases before specialist judges. Chief Justice Woolf says the
court would need to be backed up by a regulatory system that
could evaluate the work of scientists. The judge says he
supports such a court because he is frustrated with
incompetence over issues such as genetically modified crop
experiments, mad cow disease, and foot-and-mouth disease. .

In answer to your points:-

(1) The method of challenge (to the main Petition before MERC) is by Writ
Petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. This is
the procedural means by which the High Court controls and supervises the
activities of lower Courts and administrative tribunals. It is,strictly,a
public law proceeding rather than a private law proceeding.
Again,strictly,we cannot use a Writ Petition as a means of asserting a right
to have these proceedings stayed under section 45 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act 1996. That is a private law application. We could only get
that inot the High Court by first making that application to the MERC,having
it refused and then proceeding by way of statutory appeal. Clearly,a stay
application presumes that the MERC has jurisdiction.

(2) The way to tackle the injunction is to apply to have it discharged or
modified. If (perhaps when) MERC says no,there is a statutory right of
appeal to the High Court.

(3) The Writ Petition is an all or nothing excercise. Realistically,if DPC
succeeds in the Writ Petition,the MERC is dead and so (ultimately) will be
the MSEB. I think that I can fairly safely predict that in front of any
half-decent tribunal in London,the recission claim is going to go nowhere.
If,however,DPC does not succeed on jurisdiction,I cannot see a stay
application succeeding in front of the MERC. If the Court says that the MERC
has jurisdiction,you can bet your bottom dollar on the fact that it will be
excercised. No doubt DPC could file a statutory appeal to the High Court
(against a refusal to grant a stay),but that will take a very long time to
get heard in these circumstances.

(4) The prcedural stroke which requires to be played right in the High Court
is getting the Court to deal with this Writ Petition urgently. Should that
occur,we should get home sooner rather than later (working on Indian
time,that is). If,contrary to my expectation,the Court sits on the
matter,then we are in difficulties. It is going to be hard to appeal when
the decision is that there is no decision.

(5) I do not think that DPC can prudently disregard the MERC's order. Aside
from the invocation of contempt procedures against DPC,the MSEB would simply
apply to the High Court for an injunction directly. Also,will our Lenders
really allow DPC to serve a Termination Notice in these circumstances (given
that the Phase I dollar Lenders require to get to the GOI Guarantee)? I
personally doubt it. As a practical matter I believe that we have to comply
with the MERC's orders unless and until the High Court says that MERC has no
jurisdiction. The more practical approach is this. Having filed our Writ
Petition,nothing prevents us from applying to MERC to vary its current
order. If it refuses,we file a stautory appeal against its order and apply
to the Chief Justice to have both matters conjoined. That is what we ought
to be doing.

(6) I do not know enough about our PRI coverage (certainly the OPIC cover)
to say with certainty. However,the Lloyd's Policy has the better coverage
(subject to whatever right the underwriters may have to avoid for
non-disclosure on placing). That policy requires that DPC obtains an
arbitral award. I think that we should be doing all that we can to preserve
the position viz-a-viz that policy. This seems to dictate that we comply
with the MERC's orders,at least for the time being. One remedy for contempt
by a corporate body is the appointment of a receiver. The implications of
that for obtaining any arbitral award are obvious.

chris, is there any established procedure under indian
procedural or substantive law on how we challenge the
merc injunction? if we lose before the bombay high
court, e.g. they decline to consider the matter or
just sit on it, what then? appeal to the s.ct.,
mandamus? since we would have to rely on the indian
courts to enforce an arbitration award (as i recall)
what good would it do to disregard the merc's order
(and the court's) and proceed with the arbitration-- a
high risk venture--could it help us with our political
risk coverage or other extra-india protections? we
would appreciate your thoughts. best regards, jim

Mr. Derrick, I am directing this email to your attention at the request of Mr. Jim Bouillion for consideration of extending coverage to Enron Corp., pursuant to the EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES LIABILITY ENDORSEMENT on our Directors & Officers policy.

We have received a new Petition wherein a former employee of Enron Corp. (former Vice President of Operations for Enron Communications in Portland, Oregon) alleges damages as a result of sexual discrimination and retaliation along with wrongful termination.  Suit is filed in Harris County, Texas, with an Answer date of June 18, 2001.  Essentially, the Plaintiff claims to have been harassed by Ken Griebling in such a way that he created a "hostile work environment".  She filed a complaint with HR and Ken Rice, to no avail.  She was later advised her position was being eliminated and that her responsibilities were being assigned to Ken Burroughs, who she had hired and trained.  She was in turn assigned to a bandwidth trading floor position with no defined responsibilities wherein she was terminated shortly thereafter under the alleged pretext that her position had been eliminated.

Our preliminary review of the Plaintiff's Original Petition (absent any independent investigation or knowledge with respect to her allegations and the valued placed on same-pleadings allege an unspecified amount of damages) suggests there might be coverage for this loss under the Directors & Officers policy.  The definition of "WRONGFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE" includes "discrimination" which is defined as both the termination of an employee and the treatment of an employee in disparate manner from other similarly-situated employees in respect to a employee's sex, or in violation of any equivalent protection or rights which may have been conferred on any group or individual protecting them against employment discrimination under federal, state, or local law.

Please advise if you would like for us to extent coverage to the named defendant, Enron Corp.  According to the information provided, the matter has been assigned to C. Robert Vote of the Litigation Unit.

Thanks,

CHENEY SAYS HIGHER FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS STILL UNDER
CONSIDERATION

Vice President Cheney tells the heads of four national
environmental and public health groups that the Bush
administration will consider increasing the standards for
auto and truck fuel efficiency and for renewable energy, but
will not support requiring power plants to cut carbon
dioxide emissions. The chief executive officers of the four
groups meet with Bush administration officials to discuss
alternatives to the administration's national energy policy.

CHEMICALS USED AT SUPERFUND SITES TO BE REPORTED TO TOXICS
INVENTORY

EPA must report by July 1 to the Toxics Release Inventory
certain hazardous chemicals used to clean up superfund
sites. Under a new policy, any EPA regional office
performing a remedial or removal activity at a site that
results in the release of a TRI chemical over the allowed
threshold must report that release to the inventory. To be
covered under the new policy, the site cleanup must be
funded solely by the Superfund Trust Fund. . . . Page A-2

EPA TO WITHDRAW 1999 AMENDMENT ON USE OF PCB-CONTAMINATED
MATERIALS

EPA will withdraw a 1999 standard governing use of porous
surfaces, such as flooring materials, contaminated with
polychlorinated biphenyls, an EPA attorney tells BNA.  The
attorney does not know when the EPA issue the withdrawal
notice, which results from a federal appeals court ruling in
January.  Meanwhile, companies that wish to use porous
surfaces, such as concrete or wooden floors, contaminated
with PCBs must comply with requirements in a 1998 PCB rule
from EPA that requires companies to clean and paint the
PCB-contaminated surfaces. . . . Page A-8

HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS URGED TO REJECT FUNDS FOR ARCTIC OIL,
GAS EXPLORATION

Led by Rep. Markey, 58 House Democrats urge colleagues in
charge of appropriations for the Department of Interior to
reject a White House request for funding to explore the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas. A similar
letter, initiated by Rep. Johnson, is expected to be sent
from House Republicans today. A Johnson aide says the
letter, currently signed by eight Republicans, is being
circulated to gain more signatures. . . . Page A-2

AGREEMENT ON PESTICIDE REASSESSMENTS SAID TO LACK REASONABLE
DEADLINES

A consent agreement reached in January between EPA and
environmental groups does not allow enough time to review
data generated by pesticide makers, according to comments
submitted to the agency. A federal court in California is
expected to decide at a hearing next week whether to approve
the agreement, which would partly settle a lawsuit filed by
the Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups on
pesticide reviews under the Food Quality Protection Act. . .

RESEARCH SEEN NEEDED ON USE OF NATURAL ATTENUATION AT WASTE
SITES

A federal advisory committee concludes that although EPA's
monitored natural attenuation program produces
scientifically sound research, a lot is unknown about the
program and its effectiveness in cleaning up hazardous waste
sites.  In particular, the report from EPA's Science
Advisory Board cites contamination by MTBE as an area
needing more research. Monitored natural attenuation is a
waste site cleanup remedy that relies on microbes, the
weather, and other naturally occurring environmental
processes to rid an area of hazardous contaminants. . . .

REDUCED INSECTICIDE USE CITED AS BENEFIT OF GENETICALLY
ALTERED CORN

EPA should register a new plant-incorporated protectant to
reduce insecticide use and to attack the corn rootworm, U.S.
growers, states, and seed companies write in comments filed
on an application by Monsanto Co. to register "Bacillus
thuringiensis" Cry3Bb protein and the genetic material
(Vector ZMIR13L) needed to produce it in the corn. . . .

Army uniforms factory-treated with the insecticide
permethrin await approval by the Army Uniform Board. An Army

NUCLEAR WASTE REVIEW BOARD TO ISSUE YUCCA MOUNTAIN
ASSESSMENT

The independent Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board plans
to release an assessment of the Energy Department's site
characterization process for Yucca Mountain before Energy
Secretary Abraham recommends whether to proceed with that
site as a nuclear waste repository. The assessment will come
in the form of a letter to Abraham commenting on the
technical and scientific validity of the department's site
characterization process, according to the board's executive
director. Abraham is widely expected in January to complete
the site recommendation process on the Yucca Mountain
project, a proposed permanent repository for high-level
nuclear waste. . . . Page A-2

EPA PROPOSES TO RELAX REGULATIONS FOR TWO LANDFILL PROJECTS
IN VIRGINIA

As part of a pilot project, EPA proposes to relax regulatory
requirements for two municipal solid waste landfills in
Virginia to demonstrate alternative landfill liners are
sufficiently protective and to assess the effects of
applying different amounts of liquids to landfills to

EPA TARGETS REMAINING ANTHRAX IN FUMIGATION OPERATION ON
CAPITOL HILL

EPA again fumigates with chlorine dioxide gas the heating
and ventilation system of the anthrax-contaminated Hart
Senate Office Building. The third fumigation effort is
needed to rid the site of trace amounts of anthrax. . . .

BRIEFING SET ON EPA RISK ASSESSMENT FOR ORGANOPHOSPHATE
PESTICIDES

A final briefing on the methods EPA uses to develop its
preliminary assessment of the cumulative risks of
organophosphate pesticides is scheduled for Jan. 15. EPA
says it will hold the briefing to discuss how it estimated
exposure to the organophosphates. EPA also seeks public
comments on its preliminary assessment, which found
organophosphates may pose dietary risks to young children
and could present risks from residential exposures. . . .

COURT AFFIRMS NO COST ALLOCATION FOR MINIMAL RELEASE OF
CONTAMINANTS

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act, a court may decline to
allocate response costs to a polluter whose release of
hazardous materials is "inconsequential" in comparison to
that of other polluters, according to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Although the court finds
Rockwell International Corp. liable for the release of
contaminants into Michigan's Kalamazoo River, it says
Rockwell's release is miniscule when compared with those of
three paper manufacturers. . . . Page A-3

EPA CONSIDERS WHETHER TO GROUP TOGETHER TWO CLASSES OF
PESTICIDES

Public comments on whether certain members of two classes of
pesticides should be grouped together because they affect
the body in similar ways are being sought by EPA. The
agency's announcement refers to thiocarbamates, which are
used as herbicides, and dithiocarbamates, which are
primarily fungicides. Under a consent decree with the
Natural Resources Defense Council, EPA was to decide by
today whether the thiocarbamates and, separately, the
dithiocarbamates should be grouped into two distinct classes
of pesticides that cause effects through a common mechanism
of toxicity. . . . Page A-6

VIRGINIA POWER COMPANY TO PAY $600,000 TO OIL SPILL
LIABILITY TRUST FUND

Dominion Virginia Power Co. agrees to pay a $600,000 penalty
to settle alleged environmental violations at the company's
Possum Point Power Station, in Dumfries, Va., according to
EPA. The company, based in Richmond, Va., agrees to the
penalty to settle alleged past violations of oil-spill
prevention and emergency preparedness regulations at the
power plant.  EPA says the $600,000 penalty to be paid to
the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is one of the largest
civil penalties on record for such violations at a single
facility. . . . Page A-8

AIR POLLUTION: The EU Council of Environment Ministers
agrees on a proposal calling for the introduction of
"sulfur-free" gasoline and diesel fuel starting in 2005 and
mandating its use by 2009. The council approves the
proposal, despite heavy lobbying by the European oil
refining industry against the 2009 deadline, which is one
year later than the deadline approved by the European
Parliament in November. . . . Page A-6

Jim, as we discussed late last night I checked with all folks in the DC office who would have any conceivable reason to talk to Treasury.  No one had a conversation yesterday where the SEC issue was discussed.  Today, I have checked with the remainder of the DC office, and no one has had such a conversation.   I hope this is helpful.

Jim, this is the latest inquiry into the existence of the Employment Practices coverage. You will recall we were trying to maintain on a confidential basis.  It is becoming more and more difficult to avoid talking about this insurance as the exposure is often discussed in the press.  Do you have any thoughts on disclosure to NEPCO?

Mike,  According to a recent decision by the Washington Supreme Court, a
supervisor can be held personally liable for job-related discrimination or
harassment.  We need to check out with Enron Insurance group to determine if
our current employment practice liability insurance covers a situation like
this.  The distinction is that if the plaintiff employee names the company,
we're covered, but he/she names only the supervisor "personally" would the
Enron insurance decline coverage?  

By copy to Dick Vincent, I am asking him to confirm this issue with our
insurance program.  If coverage exists, then should we document something in
the policy to specifically cover this new form of employment liability
unique to Washington State?

I am sending you our most recent ASAP.  Our ASAP's are our summaries of
recent developments in employment matters.
This ASAP addresses a recent case from the Washington State Supreme Court in
which that court held that individual supervisors can be held personally
liable for acts of unlawful harassment and discrimination.  This ruling
relates to the Washington state discrimination statute and not Title VII.
This ruling is contrary to federal law under Title VII where individual
supervisors are not personally liable for such acts.  Similarly, individual
supervisors are not subject to personal liability under the Texas Commission
on Human Rights Act.  It may be prudent for employers with workers in
Washington to review insurance and indemnity agreements to determine if
these contracts cover supervisors who may be sued for acts in the course and
scope of their employment.

Dear Mr. Derrick:

	Thank you for including me in this venture.  It promises to be fun and
useful.  Unfortunately, in terms of the November 2nd meeting, a faculty
candidate I'm primarily responsible for is coming through the law school
the same day.  He is giving a colloquium late morning/early afternoon and
my wife and I are hosting the dinner for him and his wife that evening.
So, especially given the post-9/11 logistics, it doesn't seem practical for
me to come to Dallas for this meeting.  One possibility might be for me to
participate by phone for a portion of the afternoon meeting and I would be
happy to do so.  But given the nature and length of the meeting, this
probably doesn't make sense - please let me know what you think.

	Best regards.

Folks -

We received a copy of the MERC order granting interim relief.  The order grants the interim relief requested in Paragraph 202 (j) (no DPC pursuit of existing or initiation of new arbitration proceedings against MSEB) and (l) (no DPC actions under the escrow arrangements).

In my opinion, this grant of relief does not affect DPC's ability to (a) deliver Transfer Notices or further PTNs or (b) continue or initiate arbitrations against GOM/GOI.

MERC also indicated that it thinks that it has jurisdiction to consider the matters raised by MSEB in MSEB's petition but has reserved final judgment on the issue.

The next hearing is set for June 14.

We will scan the order and forward later today.

Bruce

Jordan:  (1) Yes to Section 13 (any and all filings required by the '34 Act)---10-Qs, 10-Ks, 8-Ks, 13Ds, Form 4s (pursuant to Section 16) etc.   Any and all '34 Act filings by Enron Corp. are available at the SEC's website----that is the fastest and most efficient way to access them.
(2)	SEC file number:  Enron Corp.-1-13159;
(3)	Total assets and liabilities:  I would use our latest 10-Q filed last week; however, as we all know, these are not only unaudited, we do not have the AA SAS 71 letter (limited review letter required for quarterly financials).  Perhaps we should consult Causey as to the answer to this question (although my best guess would be the third quarter financial statements just filed with the SEC;
(4)	Debt securities and number of holders---I would have no way of knowing this---I would check with corporate treasury (Tim DeSpain, Clint Freeland and the folks in their group).  The group responsible for paying the interest on our debt securities would know the answer to this, and that would be corporate treasury.  As to number of holders, they may have to contact the trustee of the debt securities (for most of the public debt securities, I believe that would be Bank of New York, as successor trustee to Harris Trust, Enron's long-time trustee; 
(5)	Number of shares of Preferred Stock ---I thought this list was included in the schedules to the Merger Agreement, but I can't seem to put my hands on the schedules.  I will try to get this list to you today or early in the morning (Sunday).  Brenda Funk may also have an up-to-date list (the recent preferred stock issuances relate to structured financings, which are deals I don't work on---that's the reason I don't have this info at my fingertips---but I think I can get it for you, tomorrow morning, if not today);
(6)	As of October 31 (according to 10-Q filed last week:  743,904,638 shares of common stock issued and outstanding (this does not include treasury shares---if we need that number, we will have to get from the corporate secretary's office);
(7)	Desciption of Enron's business:  I agree with you, we can lift this from the current 10-Q  filed last week  (anything before that may be out of date);
(8)	Look at the draft of the Proxy Statement that I sent to you yesterday (the reference to Janus is as of February of this year---as you know, institutional holders of 5% or more only have to file an annual Schedule 13G (on on before Feb. 14 of each year).  Of course, other 5% or greater owners must file a 13D shortly after acquiring their holdings, and I am not aware that we have received a Schedule 13D lately (the issuer is supposed to receive a copy, as well as the SEC).  Mark Koenig in Investor Relations might have a handle on who Enron's current owners are (without a Schedule 13D, we can assume that no one else owns in excess of 5%).  
(9)	With respect to Enron Corp. common and second preferred convertible stock, there are literally thousands of holders.  I assume the only way to get this information is the shareholder lists from the Transfer Agent (or, possibly the corporate secretary's office would have this info---if not, they would be the group that knows how to get it);
       (10) See No. 9 above.
                        
                             Jordan and Julia:   The information that we would need to get from Enron's transfer agent or Enron's trustees for its debt securities would not be available from those entities until Monday;  if we needed it before then, as noted above the best sources of information would be the Enron Treasury group (with respect to debt securities outstanding) and the corporate secretary's office (Paula Rieker and Elaine Overturf) with respect to shareholder lists.   I apologize in advance that I will be necessarily out of pocket Saturday afternoon, but plan to be in the office all day Sunday if I can help with this.  Thanks, Rex

Rex: As I mentioned in my voicemail earlier today, we need the following information this weekend for the legal entities Enron Corp(some of which I think we already have and I have noted in parenthetical, below):

(1) Whether we file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to 'Section 13 or 15 (d) of the '34 Act (Yes--which?)
(2) What is the SEC file number? (?)
(3) Total assets and total liabilities as of a specified date (Should we use our Q3/10-Q filing of last week?)
(4) Debt securities held by more than 500 holders (indicate whether secured, unsecured or subordinated, amount of debt and approximate number of holders).
(5) Number of shares of preferred stock and approximate number of holders (?)
(6) Number of shares of common and approximate number of holders (?--I believe that both #s 5 and 6 relate to issued, rather than authorized, but I'll get clarification)
(7) Brief description of Enron's business (10-Q)
(8) Names of any person who directly or indirectly owns, controls, or holds, with power to vote, 5% or more of the voting securities of Enron (?)
(9) List of all equity security holders of each class of security, including showing the number and kind of interests in the name of each holder and the last known addres or place of business of each holder(?)
(10) The list noted in #9 should reflect equity security holders as of day of filing; accordingly, transfer agent should be notified that a list will be required to enable them to prepare an accurate list.

 I may be reached in the office at 713-853-7897; home 713-838-2990; or on my cell at 713-301-4807.  It may be helpful to get Eickenroht or Clem to assist us on this.

	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Below is the response from our broker commenting on the coverage issue posed by NEPCO.  Our confidential approach to this policy is in jeopardy as more and more people are creating a need to know and the "traffic" on this topic (internally and externally) has increase considerably. On this Nepco inquiry,  I suggest that I speak with David Lund on the coverage and request that he keep same confidential and advise his operations people that they need not pursue the issue any further.  Please advise if you concur?

On this same subject, I have received a request from Michelle Cash to notify our insurers of a potential "age discrimination " claim.  EEOC has made an "inquiry",  which means (according to Michelle), that they have received a complaint and want information. I have discussed with our broker, and they recommend, based upon review of the reporting provisions in the policy, that we file a report of a potential claim with underwriters. I do not have the all facts nor do I have copies of any of any documents, however, understand that this arises from the "Performance Review process". This is one we should discuss, as it could involve a large class of people.  Please give me a call.

Mike,  According to a recent decision by the Washington Supreme Court, a
supervisor can be held personally liable for job-related discrimination or
harassment.  We need to check out with Enron Insurance group to determine
if
our current employment practice liability insurance covers a situation like
this.  The distinction is that if the plaintiff employee names the company,
we're covered, but he/she names only the supervisor "personally" would the
Enron insurance decline coverage?

By copy to Dick Vincent, I am asking him to confirm this issue with our
insurance program.  If coverage exists, then should we document something
in
the policy to specifically cover this new form of employment liability
unique to Washington State?

I am sending you our most recent ASAP.  Our ASAP's are our summaries of
recent developments in employment matters.
This ASAP addresses a recent case from the Washington State Supreme Court
in
which that court held that individual supervisors can be held personally
liable for acts of unlawful harassment and discrimination.  This ruling
relates to the Washington state discrimination statute and not Title VII.
This ruling is contrary to federal law under Title VII where individual
supervisors are not personally liable for such acts.  Similarly, individual
supervisors are not subject to personal liability under the Texas
Commission
on Human Rights Act.  It may be prudent for employers with workers in
Washington to review insurance and indemnity agreements to determine if
these contracts cover supervisors who may be sued for acts in the course
and
scope of their employment.

	When we talked a couple of weeks ago, you said that you thought that you
could give me an e mail address for Tim Battaglia, who is now in your London
office.  He is an old friend, and I now expect to go to London relatively
frequently because my recently-married daughter lives there.

	I appreciate your help!

EPA DELAYS PLAN TO STREAMLINE REGULATIONS FOR TREATING
WASTEWATER

A final rule to streamline regulations governing the
wastewater pretreatment program will be delayed until 2003
to allow EPA time to obtain and review additional
information pertaining to the regulation, according to the
director of the EPA Office of Wastewater Management. He says
that in addition to needing more information on the question
of acidity, the agency has had to divert resources away from
the rulemaking to other areas. EPA proposed changes to its
national pretreatment program in July 1999 to provide some
regulatory relief to industrial users and the publicly owned
treatment works into which they discharge wastewater. . . .

QUICK ACTION SET FOR PROPOSED HAZMAT TRANSPORT LOADING,
UNLOADING RULE

Despite industry opposition, the Department of
Transportation intends to move "as expeditiously as
possible" on a proposed rule clarifying hazardous materials
transportation regulations on loading, unloading, and
storage. In a notice slated for publication today, the
department's Research and Special Programs Administration
extends until Feb. 1, the comment period on the proposed
rule. Citing security concerns in the aftermath of the Sept.
11 terrorist strikes, hazardous materials industry groups
asked DOT to withdraw the proposed rule, arguing that the
proposal poses security problems. . . . Page A-1

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y9q1t5_


FUGITIVE EMISSIONS NOT COUNTED TO DETERMINE MAJOR AIR
POLLUTION SOURCES

EPA no longer will count certain fugitive emissions of
nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and
other air pollutants considered nontoxic in determining
whether a facility is a "major source" of air pollution
subject to state operating permit programs. Fugitive
emissions are those that are not emitted from smoke stacks,
process vents or storage tanks. EPA says fugitive emissions
of toxic air pollutants will still be counted to determine
whether they are major sources. The decision will allow EPA
to grant full approval to Arizona and New York for their
operating permit programs. . . . Page A-3

REPORTING GUIDANCE PUBLISHED FOR MONITORING UNREGULATED
CONTAMINANTS

EPA issues reporting guidance for drinking water systems to
submit to the agency the results of monitoring, surveys, and
other assessments of unregulated contaminants.  The guidance
includes schedules for monitoring based on the size of a
drinking water system, on the source of the water, and on
the likelihood of finding unregulated contaminants. It also
contains guidelines for sampling and procedures for entering
data into EPA's national database. The data, required under
the 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act, will be
used to determine whether EPA will study further or develop
regulations for a list of contaminants developed in 1999. .

FORMER EPA OFFICIAL NAMED TO SOLID WASTE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE
POST

EPA names a former senior agency official to the post of
associate assistant administrator for solid waste and
emergency response. Thomas Dunne is appointed to the
position in the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency
Response, where he will work under Marianne Lamont Horinko,
the assistant administrator for that office. . . . Page A-7

SENATE DEMOCRATS FINISHING ENERGY LEGISLATION FOR
INTRODUCTION THIS WEEK

The Democratic authors of a comprehensive energy package
that may include contentious vehicle fuel efficiency
standards and measures for greenhouse gas reductions expect
Senate Majority Leader Daschle to introduce the legislation
as early as Thursday. Meanwhile, Senate Republican leaders
are threatening to attach their own energy bill to every
piece of legislation that reaches the Senate floor. . . .

FBI ALERT ASKS OIL, GAS COMPANIES FOR EXTRA PRECAUTIONS
AGAINST TERRORISM

The FBI asks the nation's oil and gas companies to be on
heightened alert for possible retaliatory terrorist attacks.
Terry Boss, vice president for environment and safety with
the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, confirms
receiving the FBI alert and forwarding it to members.
Attorney General Ashcroft refers to an "uncorroborated
report of undetermined reliability about natural gas"
received "maybe 10 days or close to two weeks ago." . . .

STATE NEWS
__________

OREGON: The petroleum underground storage tank program is
shifting its focus from conversions of old tanks to the
inspection of new tanks, according to Oregon's Department of
Environmental Quality.  In operation since 1985, the program
is responsible for the closing of some 26,000 underground
tanks. Currently, the department holds permits for 6,077
tanks. About 300 underground tanks still need to be removed,
says the director of the state program. With the conversion
and decommissioning of older tanks nearly completed, the
department will now emphasize the safe operation of new
tanks. . . . Page A-4

MINNESOTA: An alfalfa-processing plant remains closed almost
two weeks after the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency
ordered it shut because of its alleged failure to meet the
legal limits for dust. The plant, which is owned by the
Minnesota Valley Alfalfa Producers in Priam, could be
operating again within days, according to the cooperative's
general manager. He says the plant is in the process of
being upgraded to enable it to meet the standards. . . .

Jim and Rob:
I hope you are both well and was really pleased to see that last week's
merger negotiations reached a successful outcome.This must have required an
incredible effort in the timescale and given everything else that is going
on.I very much hope this will allow  you to enjoy a more stable period after
the events of the last few weeks.You both have many friends at Linklaters
and we are all pulling for you at this time.
I also thought you may like to have a brief overview of the main areas in
which we are assisting at the moment.These are as follows:
1Merger:We are working with Robert Eickenroht on the UK/European anti-trust
aspects.This kicked off with a conference call today.Greatly appreciate the
instructions, Jim.
2Dabhol:We are continuing our role on Dabhol which is now primarily focused
on the litigation side and a major commitment for a 2 partner team-Chris
Walker is ,I believe, in Houston tomorrow to meet with Bruce Lundstrum and
others.Input from the projects side continues (principally in relation to
Sch 11,PPA) but is not likely to be extensive over the next month or so
given the current emphasis in India.
3Enron Europe:We are in close contact with Mark and have a number of ongoing
/ new matters.In particular, we have a dedicated team advising Europe on its
position and contingency planning for current circumstances-this team has
been liaising with Mark Haedicke and the Weil Gotchal team.We are also
assisting on some potential disposals in non core business areas.Our London
secondee remains in place.
4Other:We have a number of ongoing matters ranging from SEDCO litigation
through a bid for LNG purchases from Nigeria LNG.Given the understandable
emphasis on cost control at this time, it may be that we should review these
matters to determine whether you feel it appropriate to  scale back legal
spend in some areas?
On the question of payment,we have invoices totalling more than ?5 million
outstanding and this  level of commitment ,of course, continues to grow in
the light of our ongoing work.As mentioned on Friday, we do need to reduce
this to a more manageable level ( we are currently speaking with Mark and
Bruce, in particular, to find a way of achieving this) and your continuing
support in this effort would be greatly appreciated.
We really want to do all we can,at both a personal and professional level,
to support Enron at this time-I am particularly conscious of the support and
friendship you have given to me over the years.If there is anything else we
can do, please do call me at any time.For convenience my nos. are:
W:44 207 456 5912
M:44 7733 124030
H:44 1959 533292
Best Wishes
Stuart

I am informed that you are travelling to India for the hearing in the MERC WP. Here's the latest, according to me.
The WP is expected to be listed fairly low down on the cause list (board or docket of the Court) for Monday 11 June 2001. In the normal course, I do not expect it will reach hearing on Monday. The Advocate-General has indicated that MSEB will be ready to go for a hearing on Monday. He said to AMS today that an affidavit of the MSEB will be served tomorrow on DPC (it will be Shobhan's office!). The Division Bench as per the assignment will take admission matters  (and ours is an admission matter) only on Mondays and Tuesdays of the week. Therefore if it appears at 2 p.m., when the Judges will rise for lunch, that the matter is unlikely to reach on Monday / Tuesday next week, an application will be made to the Judges at 2.45 p.m. (when the Court re-assembles after the lunch break) that the DPC WP be placed "High on Board" on tuesday so that it reaches hearing on that day. The urgency that will be pointed out is that MERC has kept the matter on 14 June 2001.
It is possible that when such aplication is made (or if the matter has reached int he normal course) that the Court may say that since this matter is likely to take time for hearing, it is better if it is set up for hearing on a day when the cause list of the Court is not inundated with admission work. If this happens, we are relegated to any day Wednesday onwards and it could even be beyond 14 June 2001. Obviously, in that case, if the next date is after 14 June 2001, suitable orders will be sought that the hearing before MERC on 14 June does not proceed.
I hope this clarifies the position here. Please feel free to contact me in case you need any further information. 
Please note that my e-mail address has changed to atul_rajadhyaksha@atulrajadhyaksha.com .

SUPREME COURT SAYS CAPS ON COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN FEDERAL
JOB BIAS SUITS DON'T APPLY TO FRONT PAY AWARDS

Front pay awards in federal employment discrimination suits
are not subject to the 1991 Civil Rights Act's caps on
compensatory damages, the U.S. Supreme Court rules. The
unanimous decision resolves a circuit split in favor of the
majority view on the issue.

Front pay is money awarded either for lost compensation
between the date of judgment and the date of reinstatement
or in lieu of reinstatement. The front pay remedy has long
been available under Section 706(g) of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act. Because the 1991 Act authorized compensatory and
punitive damages "in addition to" remedies already available
under Section 706(g), the court concludes that the caps do
not apply to front pay awards. . . . Page 1727

INNOVATIVE MAINE LAW MAKING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AVAILABLE AT
DISCOUNT TO UNINSURED SURVIVES CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES

Maine's novel prescription drug price control statute is not
preempted by the Medicaid statute and does not violate the
commerce clause, the First Circuit rules. The Maine program
makes prescription drugs available at a discount to
uninsured state residents who do not qualify for Medicaid,
and requires prior state authorization of the prescriptions
of drug manufacturers who decline to negotiate rebates with
the state.

Rejecting a conflict preemption claim, the court says the
rebate negotiation and prior authorization features are
"consonant" with the Medicaid program by making prescription
drugs more accessible to low-income people. Finding no merit
to the commerce clause challenge, the court says that the
Maine statute does not apply extraterritorially or
discriminate against out-of-state manufacturers, and that
its local benefits outweigh any burden on interstate
commerce. . . . Page 1729

JUSTICES ADOPT SINGLE-ENTITY APPROACH FOR CALCULATING
PRODUCT LIABILITY LOSS OF AFFILIATES FILING CONSOLIDATED
RETURN

The product liability loss for an affiliated group of
corporations filing a consolidated return should be
determined using the single-entity approach urged by the
taxpayer, not the separate-member methodology urged by the
government, the U.S. Supreme Court decides. The ruling
resolves a circuit split on the availability of the product
liability loss carryback under Section 172 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

In the government's view, affiliates that generate positive
separate taxable income should not contribute to product
liability loss eligible for the carryback. But the court
finds the taxpayer's single-entity approach a preferable
reading of the tax code and applicable regulations,
rejecting the government's claim that it will lead to tax
avoidance abuses. . . . Page 1733

	Bob and I just spoke with Steve Susman.  I tried to mention the points you asked.  Here are his comments:

	1.  F&J probably could not simply send us our files back and put itself in a position to be adverse to us with Arthur Anderson.  Susman believes that there is a "hot potato" rule that prevents F&J from doing so.

	2.  That being said, Susman doesn't care if F&J represents Arthur Anderson or anyone else potentially adverse to us in the actions he is handling. 

	3.  Susman would not, however, agree to a broad advance ethical waiver, as proposed by F&J.  He does not believe such waivers are effective.  Susman would agree to a waiver once we were advised who F&J wanted to represent.  I don't know whether F&J would agree to this or not. 

	4.  Susman recognizes that we cannot force F&J to take on the new Mariner matter, and that this is ultimately a risk/benefit decision for us to make, and that we may have to agree to terms that we otherwise wouldn't agree to. 

	Parenthetically, I have received no comments on F&J's proposed waiver letter.

	Under the circumstances, from his standpoint, Bob is inclined for us to get the best deal on the waiver letter that we can with F&J, but that if F&J won't budge, that we take something along the lines of what they have given us (Bob, let me know if I have mischaracterized your thoughts).  

	From my standpoint, I unfortunately think there are some parts of the letter that we must have changed.  This would be to the extent that the letter purports to have Enron Corp. agree to bind all the Enron entities, and to the extent that it involves Enron's agreement to what will happen after the Dynegy merger (as I set out in my earlier e-mail).  My recommendation would be, as set forth in my earlier e-mail, that only the Enron entities currently being represented by F&J sign it and be bound by it, and to remove the language regarding what Enron would agree to after the Dynegy merger.  I also find the advance ethical waiver language repugnant, but could agree to it if the other modifications mentioned could be made.  I do not know whether F&J would be willing to make these changes or not.

	Our biggest problem right now is time-management.  I know that Mariner wanted to make a decision by today as to who to use.  I am willing to confer with Dutton ASAP to see what F&J would agree to, and if he can agree in principle, to send him a proposed draft agreement.  I believe he is out of the office but is checking his voice-mail.  

	Please let me know what you want me to do.

	Britt

Subject:	Dabhol -- A Brief Legal Update

Gentlemen -

A few updates:

   We hope to file the petition on Monday in the Bombay High Court seeking
   a ruling that the MERC does not have jurisdiction over the PPA and the
   current disputes between MSEB and Dabhol Power Company.

   The Dabhol lenders have planned 3 days of meetings in Singapore this
   coming week and we will attend these meetings.  Our lenders seem to be
   increasingly nervous.  They may try to cure the construction contract
   defaults (over $30 million would be required in mid-June).  While we do
   not relish having the construction contracts fall away, we do not
   believe that funding is prudent at this point.  MSEB has torn up the PPA
   and stated that it will not cooperate with Phase II power station
   testing, the only real remaining function under the power plant
   construction contract.

   A few insolvency/creditors' rights lawyers from Skadden will be here on
   Wednesday to discuss Dabhol creditor remedies and possible DPC defenses
   (both in India and the U.S.).  A lawyer from Susman Godfrey is scheduled
   to join us at that meeting.

Subject:	Dabhol Power Project - Counsel


Bruce,

Here is the position:-

(1) Johnny Veeder QC has been retained.

(2) Subject to receiving a confirmatory e-mail overnight,I have retained (on
a no-cost basis) Stewart Boyd QC and Gordon Pollock QC. (Boyd wrote the
standard English law text,and we thought about using him last time around.
Pollock will be well known to Jim Derrick,as having acted against Enron in J
Block. Boyd and Pollock are in the same Chambers as johnny Veeder QC,and
they share the same Clerk. I am waiting for written confirmation from him by
e-mail that they are retained as stand-ins for Johnny Veeder QC as we may
require them).

(3) I have retained Jonathan Sumption QC and Lord Grabiner QC. I have done
so by giving them a small amount of "homework" to do. There are a number of
PPA questions where second and third views are useful in any case,so the
costs are not wasted in any event. We are not commited in any case to using
them as advocates,although we might very well wish to have the option on
them.

The five names mentioned represent very much the magic circle for
arbitration work. Indeed,Grabiner,Pollock and Sumption are the magic circle
for almost all conceivable commercial litigation purposes in London (and
many that are not).

There are two others possibly who are widely regarded as being magic circle
members. These are: (a) Peter Goldsmith QC and (b) Sydney Kentridge QC.

Peter Goldsmith QC does not do a great deal of arbitration work,but he is a
recognised "name".

Sydney Kentridge QC is now in his mid-70s,and is virtually exclusively an
appellate advocate. He does not do "heavy" cases at first instance anymore.
I think that you could fairly safely treat it as inherently unlikely in the
extreme that he would take this one on for the MSEB etc.

The cost of taking Peter Goldsmith QC off-side through the "homework" route
would be roughly ?10k or ?12k,perhaps a little more (but not a great deal
more). Please let me know whether you wish me to do this.

At the end of the day,the bar in London is big enough and deep enough for
the MSEB etc. always to be able to find an advocate who is good. My efforts
have been directed to:(a) getting a pool of the best on-side for DPC,as
needed; and (b) putting the same people off-side for the MSEB etc. I would
not have thought it useful or necessary to go further than Peter Goldsmith
QC in that excericse.

Jeff / John,

We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals =
Limited (EML). As you know we have been particularly concerned about watchi=
ng our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to und=
erstand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint. Aft=
er your review, we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss. If you co=
ncur with the actions suggested, please advise.  If there is any balance sh=
eet, debtor/creditor or cash forecast information that you require, please =
let us know.

Drew Lynch, Kevin Heffron, Jonathan Marsh, and Joe Gold



Introduction

Enron Metals Limited  (EML) maintains a unique position within Enron Corp. =
 EML is one of Enron's two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Service=
s Authority (FSA - the UK financial regulator) and Enron's only remaining b=
rokerage business.  Given its special status, EML has responsibilities to i=
ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the L=
ME (metals exchange) of which it is a member.  As a result of this regulato=
ry oversight, there are several differences between EML and Enron's other b=
usinesses:
1)=09EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato=
ry rules relating, among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus=
iness. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d=
isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers.

2)=09By virtue of its position as an LME broker, there are certain circumst=
ances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients.  EML's p=
olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible; however, EML's cond=
uct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship=
 to exist.  How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th=
e FSA and the LME.

3)=09Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets an=
d to protect against systemic risk, EML's position as a provider of liquidi=
ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la=
ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME. As a co=
nsequence of this concern, the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain =
prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi=
tion and credit risk. The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA =
regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc=
e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem=
ent. These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital, which can be =
used by way of regulatory capital, and a breach of these rules is regarded =
as extremely serious. An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ=
irement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to c=
ease carrying on business.

4)=09EML's board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o=
versight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for=
 a breach of the rules. Penalties for individuals include significant fines=
 and possible expulsion from the industry. The duties owed by board members=
 under the FSA's rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law r=
elating to directors' duties.

Directors Overriding Ring Fencing Obligation

In the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem=
onstrate to the FSA that, to the full extent possible, the financial streng=
th of EML is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by t=
he rest of Enron.  In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation =
we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below.

Issues Surrounding Liquidity

As we are all aware over the past week, as a result of the reputation probl=
ems the corporation has been faced with, we have substantially increased th=
e hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML.  This was a precautio=
n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML.  Clearly the =
goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing =
of EML was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to t=
he non-EML related problems of Enron.  This of course needed to be accompli=
shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron comp=
any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was=
 concerned =20

The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains=
 and distributes its cash.  In the event, that cash is lent outside of EML,=
 it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory cap=
ital of the firm; however, the firm has a number of options to preserve its=
 day to day liquidity.=20
=20
In its position as an LME broker, EML must have access to cash for two purp=
oses.  First, it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House (=
LCH).  In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collater=
al to the LCH, it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforc=
ement action could ensue. In addition it would be declared a defaulter and =
the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions.  Second, it=
 must be able to post margin to its clients.  A failure to make a contractu=
al payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referre=
d to the FSA.  A third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-=
money clients in the event that they wish to close their account.  While th=
ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market pr=
ofits, the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation quest=
ions.

Previously, we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari=
os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity. However ce=
rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to =
fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from=
 the rest of Enron has become a concern.  EML has or is in the process of l=
osing $60,000,000 of unsecured LC's, which were primarily used in lieu of c=
ash at the LCH.  EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC'=
s.  Additionally, a number of clients have requested that their accounts be=
 transferred.  Those transfers have reduced EML's cash balance.  Was the re=
maining $50 mm unsecured LC (which has been issued by a single bank) to be =
withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid=
ity impact.

The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo=
r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality.  Therefore we have =
agreed to start to do the following
a.=09Change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid=
ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t=
he rest of the enterprise
b.=09Improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control=
 as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnel
c.=09Manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints=
 of continuing to do business on a normal basis
d.=09Obtain financial information on a much more timely basis
e.=09Periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a=
s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity
f.=09 Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additi=
onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou=
r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis

Operational Risk =20

In theory, EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account=
s and rely on Enron Corp. for the remaining portion of its day to day cash =
needs.  EML's board have been resistant to this practice for several very p=
ractical reasons.  First, it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly ca=
ll on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis.  I=
f EML relied on Enron Corp.'s daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs, =
it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp. or an acco=
unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either=
 capital or liquidity events as EML's clearing account at Citibank would be=
 substantially overdrawn.  Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event mi=
ght create a cascade for Enron, EML's board is reluctant to put that much f=
aith in the 100% accuracy of our operational safeguards.

Capital

As noted above, EML is subject to the FSA's regulatory capital rules and mu=
st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis.  The FSA requires th=
at EML notify it if its capital base is less than 110% of the minimum finan=
cial resources requirement.  For a variety of reasons, there were occasions=
 when EML violated the 110% threshold on occasions in 2001. Because these v=
iolations were self-contained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enfo=
rcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain=
s financial resources in excess of 120% so that it has a sufficient buffer =
not to trigger the FSA notification requirement. In the current climate the=
 FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari=
se from Enron's perceived financial weakness. Accordingly, if one of those =
violations occurred today, the FSA would likely commence a formal investiga=
tion of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in ligh=
t of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EM=
L's cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily =
basis, EML's board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev=
el of 130%.  Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces=
s capital adequacy go hand in hand. =20

Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress Testing

The stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce=
narios, which would cause liquidity issues for EML

1)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte=
rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral=
 rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH
2)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house ac=
count resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH
3)=09Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME =
brokers
4)=09Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i=
nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca=
sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly=20
5)=09Credit exposures leading to credit losses

Recommendations

The result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following=
 changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov=
erall operational liquidity

1)=09To fully draw down the remaining $25 mm available under the  $125 mm s=
ubordinated facility
2)=09To monetize the inter-company marked to market positions (+$20 mm)
3)=09To increase the subordinated facility to $175 mm and extend the maturi=
ty by six months to July 2002
4)=09To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi=
ts and other assets held by EML
5)=09To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch=
 to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol=
d for calling margin
6)=09To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients, other th=
an a select group of key relationship clients=20
7)=09To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c=
ompanies (EMCL and EMCC) therefore shifting the need for inventory finance


Current Situation

Unsecured Guaranty=09=09=09$65 mm
Secured Guaranty=09=09=09$15 mm
Subordinated Loans=09=09=09$107 mm
EML Cash Balance:=09=09=09$59 mm
Cash required to replace
Withdrawn guaranty=09=09=09($20mm)


EML Regulatory Capital Level:=09128%
Excess Reg. Capital over 110%:=09$30 mm

Conclusion

The attached financial analysis shows the result of the initial stress test=
ing.
The analysis shows certain low probability sets of circumstances where we w=
ould have liquidity issues.  Given these possible eventualities we would ur=
ge that we move forward on points noted in bold above in addition to comple=
ting point f in the Issues Surrounding Liquidity Section

THIRD CIRCUIT TASK FORCE URGES ONLY LIMITED USE OF AUCTIONS
TO PICK CLASS COUNSEL; JUDGES CRITICAL OF REPORT'S
NEGATIVITY

Judicially controlled auctions for the selection of counsel
in class actions should be used only in "certain limited
circumstances," according to a draft report issued by the
Third Circuit Task Force on Selection of Class Counsel. An
auction might be appropriate for a case in which the
defendant's liability appears clear, damages appear to be
both very large and collectible, and the lead plaintiff is
not a sophisticated litigant that has already retained
counsel of its choice through a reasonable, arm's-length
process, the task force suggests.

Several judges criticize the report as being too hostile
toward the innovative idea of competitive bidding for
selecting class counsel. The judges, participating in a
panel discussion at the 2001 Third Circuit Judicial
Conference, say the report is "too restrictive." For
instance, the task force should encourage more
experimentation with the process of setting fees at the
outset of litigation rather than waiting until the end, one
judge suggests. But others, who agree with the tenor of the
report, say bidding is overrated as a means of keeping
counsel fees reasonable. . . . Page s 2326,  . . . Page 2318

NEW YORK BAR PROPOSES AMENDING ABA MODEL RULES TO ALLOW
CAREFULLY REGULATED MULTIDISCIPLINARY ALLIANCES

The New York State Bar Association files a proposal with the
American Bar Association recommending amendment of the Model
Rules of Professional Conduct to allow limited and carefully
regulated "contractual relationships" and other affiliations
between lawyers and nonlawyers who want to offer their
clients integrated multidisciplinary services.

Foremost among the safeguards being advocated by the New
York bar are measures that would prohibit nonlawyers from
holding any ownership or managerial interest in law firms;
sharing legal fees with lawyers; directing or regulating the
professional judgment of lawyers; or compromising in any
other way a lawyer's duty to safeguard client interests. The
proposal is patterned on recent amendments to the New York
Code of Professional Responsibility allowing such
affiliations. . . . Page 2315

INS ADOPTS INTERIM PROCEDURES FOR ADJUDICATING CASES OF
UNREMOVABLE ALIENS SEEKING RELEASE FROM DETENTION

The Immigration and Naturalization Service issues an interim
rule governing detention of aliens who are subject to final
orders of removal but cannot likely be removed in the
foreseeable future because no country will accept them. The
rule responds to the U.S. Supreme Court's recent "Zadvydas"
decision, which held that, absent special circumstances, the
attorney general lacks authority to detain such aliens
indefinitely.

The rule specifies procedures for aliens who have been
detained beyond the statutory 90-day removal period to
demonstrate that their removal is unlikely in the reasonably
foreseeable future. Aliens seeking relief must make a
threshold showing that they have cooperated with the INS's
efforts to effect their removal. Aliens who prevail on such
claims must be released, subject to conditions of
supervision, unless "special circumstances" would render
release dangerous. . . . Page 2321

ATTORNEYS: The ABA ethic's committee says it is not
unethical for a former in-house corporate counsel to pursue
a wrongful discharge action against her ex-employer so long
as the lawyer does not reveal more client information than
reasonably necessary to establish the claim. . . . Page 2315

EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION: The Equal Employment Opportunity

on the reform of judicial elections say the election process
is becoming "nastier, noisier and costlier," but that the

OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY: The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration reaches an agreement with the National
Association of Manufacturers that will settle NAM's lawsuit

TAXATION: The Senate votes to extend the Internet tax
moratorium by two years, but declines to address online
sales tax concerns, leaving it up to the states to develop a
more streamlined system for the collection and distribution
of sales and uses taxes stemming from online sales. The
legislation, already approved by the House, will almost
certainly be signed by the president. . . . Page 2324

Jim - The early estimate of $100,000 was way low and ignored Options.  Short answer:  Avg. Board fees in 2000 were $79,000 (about 1/3 required to be deferred).  Plus avg. phantom stock grant of $53,000 and stock options of $205,000, for total AVG 2000 value of $337000.  Obviously big variable is value of options, which are based on a fixed number but a varying Black Scholes value.  Paula

Gentlemen -

Following the Dabhol dictate that "bad news is good news," Dabhol is getting some good news this week.

As reported in the press, DPC did receive a two-page letter from MSEB purporting to rescind the PPA with immediate effect because DPC materially misrepresented the capabilities of the power plant (i.e., 6 hour actual ramp-up time vs. 3 hour ramp-up schedule in the PPA).  However, the letter goes on to state that MSEB is "agreeable to continue the present arrangement of power and payment until disputes are resolved by the appropriate forum."  We are not entirely sure what this last part means and are asking MSEB for clarification.  Obviously, this letter is quite a buttress to our already-delivered PTN contending that MSEB has evidenced an intention not to be bound by the PPA.

While MSEB's letter seems to state that they will still honor some aspects of the PPA, the letter adds that "payments would be subject to adjustments on the basis of determination of reasonable compensation and quantum meruit by a competent authority."  We hear rumors that MSEB will approach the Maharasthra Energy Regulatory Commission (MERC) for a "how much should we pay DPC" determination.  If they do so and MERC accepts jurisdiction, this would help our expropriation, political force majeure and default arguments.

DPC seems to have managed to avoid a construction contractor termination in May by agreeing to extend the required completion date for Block B by 9 days.  While this action does not have long-term benefits to the project, I believe that it was a considerable sign of good faith that DPC is trying to give the lenders some time to assess whether they want to begin curing project agreement defaults on an ongoing basis.

Bruce

Dear Jim:

I am planning to be in Houston later this month when two of my Moscow-based
partners, Bruce Bean and Ivan Marisin, will be speaking there at a
Production Sharing conference. Once being in Houston, I would very much like
to pay you a visit, remembering the invitatiuon you kindly extended to me
when visiting our offices a couple of years ago. Of course, I would also
like to introduce to you Bruce and Ivan, both of whom do work in the energy
field and in other areas Enron is active in.

We expect to arrive in Houston in the afternoon of Tuesday May 29 and depart
in the afternoon of Thursday May 31. It would be great if you we were to
have some time for us, and I would appreciate it very much if you could send
me a brief email and let me know whether a meeting with you might work out.

Independently, I will also try to contact Mark Haedicke so as to see whether
I could se him again, too.

With best regards

Jim Bouillion of CRM and Gary Cooney of McGriff, Seibels (our insurance broker) asked that I raise three matters with you: 1. Scheduling of a meeting with the D & O carriers' counsel; 2. Obtaining additional D & O coverage; and, 3. Defense counsel selection in light of the possible "advise of counsel" defense and subrogation rights of the carriers.  I know that you are covered up, but I would not expect discussion of these issues to take more than 15 minutes. I will wait to hear form you or Steph. Thanks.

Dear General Counsels:

On Monday, May 21, 2001, our two summer associates, Chike Okpara and Reginald Sewell will begin their summer rotation program with Enron.

As you know, both of these gentlemen have just completed their first year of law school at the University of Texas School of Law.

Our summer program is for twelve-thirteen weeks beginning on May 21, 2001 and ending on August 17, 2001.  Since school begins on August 20, 2001, I anticipate that each student may wish to end his rotation during the week of August 13, 2001, thus leaving time for a brief vacation to be taken before school starts. 

Mr. Okpara's rotations are:

	May 21, 2001 through June 15, 2001		Corp. Legal/ETS Legal Dept.
	
	June 18, 2001 through July 13, 2001		Enron Global Finance Legal Dept.

	July 16, 2001 through August 17, 2001		Enron Wholesale Services Legal Dept.

Mr. Sewell's rotations are:

	May 21, 2001 through June 15, 2001		Enron Global Finance Legal Dept.

	June 18, 2001 through July 13, 2001		Enron Broadband Services Legal Dept.

	July 16, 2001 through August 17, 2001		Enron Energy Services Legal Dept.

Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell will attend New Hire Orientation on Monday, May 21, 2001.  I will be at New Hire Orientation to meet and greet them.  I will also present the Enron Code of Ethics.  New Hire Orientation ends at noon.  Following New Hire Orientation, I will take Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell to lunch.  I anticipate introducing them to their first respective rotations at 2:00 pm on Monday, May 21, 2001.

I have sent their resumes to you under separate cover.

Thanks so much for your participation in this program.

Please call me at 713-853-7224 if you have any questions.

Thank you.

Sharon

John, Jim,

are we happy for Clifford Chance to act commercially on the other side of the table from Enron. I have no problem with this from my side.

I'd be grateful to hear from you. This appears to be urgent for CC.

Dear Mark,

Do you have any news re our acting for a client in acquiring an equity stake
in Wessex Water? I am being chased by my partners about obtaining clearance
for them to act.

Please excuse me for in turn chasing you about this; I certainly appreciate
that you will have more important matters at your hands to deal with these
days, but for us accepting or refusing mandates from clients or would-be
clients time is of the essence; I am sure that you will understand this.

With best regards

Jim, I am so glad that the 2001 law conference went so well -- we have received many favorable comments from the attendees.  Today we had a post-conference meeting with the group that worked on the conference, and we went over what worked well and what didn't.  It was very productive.

One of the things that came out of our meeting was the need to promptly appoint next year's Chairman of the CLE committee.  Michelle feels that putting that person in place now will greatly aid in the transition from this year to next year's planning.  As a matter of fact, she is meeting with her committee for the last time next week and would love to announce the new chair at that time.

So, could you please think about to whom you would like to give that distinct honor?  I've asked Michelle to e-mail you information about her committee and her suggestions regarding a chair.

Thanks so much for your help and input.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
[Maclean, Iona]   
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was  to set up a working group similiar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

More than 40 companies participated in the meeting, representing producers, end users, Dutch and German transportation companies, marketing, and trading companies. More than 12 companies, including Ruhrgas and Gaz de France, were interested in joining the working group, but in the end the decision was taken to restrict the number of companies making up the working group to eight so as to ensure effecient and effective decision-making. The following companies were elected to become members of the working group: Centrica, Gasunie, Wingas, BEB, Statoil, Distrigaz, Duke Energy and Enron. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

The working group will meet again on May 31st to begin developing a full-service hub agreement and, after the success of this first meeting, Enron is optimistic that the Emden/Oude Hub could be up and running by October 2001.

ENRON IN THE PRESS

Paul Hennemeyer on European energy market liberalisation - "France.....is not the only bad boy in the class.  If I was their teacher, I would make all of them [the EU countries] stay behind after school for extra lessons" (Financial Times)

"Companies like Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Dynegy (DYN) that took advantage of the state's buying binge are looking pretty fat and happy. In fact, they have affectionately started calling the governor Gravy Days. Enron Corp. (ENE), which has been selling aggressively for two months, according to traders, is looking like a genius as usual. Generators that held out, like Reliant Energy (REI) and Duke Energy (DUK), may be sorry that they did".  Dow Jones Energy Service on long-term power contracts in California (18th May 2001)


EBUY PHASE II

The P2P Team are happy to announce the imminent  rollout of eBuy Phase II, Enron Europe's online procurement tool.  Following the successful deployment of Phase I last October, the P2P Team have incorporated additional functionality to enhance the tool and to streamline Enron's procurement processes.  The range of goods and services which you will be able to buy using eBuy Phase II has increased significantly.   

eBuy Phase II will also contain the first cut of Enron Europe's preferred supplier list for all non specialist goods and services. The preferred supplier list will act as a useful directory for all Enron staff, listing our preferred suppliers in a wide variety of areas. If  you have a preferred supplier for any goods or services, which you would like to nominate for the list, please contact Erika Moore in the P2P Team on 36737.

Mandatory training for assistants will begin at the end of May, with training for authorisers and general users in mid-June, together with Auditorium presentations for pizza lovers!

NEWS FROM NORTH AMERICA . . .ENTOUCH  BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel.  The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide.  The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas.

These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.  In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets.

Enron North America-Upstream Products
Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.  The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. 
Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities.  In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu.  
Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.
ENA West Power
Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.  With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators.

ENRON EMPLOYEES VISITING NEW YORK CITY - PLEASE READ ON..........
After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron is continuing to explore new ways to exponentially increase its brand awareness not only through television, but by exploring new mediums. 

To this end, we are supporting the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who designed the unique building at the end of our "Ode to Why" commercial. His art dominates skylines around the world and, known for challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the "Leading Company in the World."

All employees are invited to visit this exhibition free of charge with an Enron ID Badge or business card beginning May 18. For more details, please visit  http://home.enron.com

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Subject: FW: ENS - Draft Form of Acceptance


Good Afternoon

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

regards

Ed  

Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice. 
NOTE I would really like to complete this by Wednesday this week as this is my last week.

A friend of mine, Jim McCloskey, a Director at Ernst & Young, mentioned to me that one of his partners and former Vice Chairman of E&Y, Bob Herdman, was recently named Chief Accountant to the SEC and asked whether E&Y could be of any assistance with respect to the present SEC inquiry.  I told Jim that I would convey his request to the appropriate personnel.  If you or any one wanted to discuss this matter further with Jim he can be reached at 713-750-8206.

I do know that Jim had met with Jeff Skilling earlier this year to talk about opportunities in E&Y working with Enron and I think he has another meeting scheduled  in November with Rick Causey and others for a follow up presentation, all unrelated to the SEC inquiry.

Regards,

Scott Dieball

Jim:

Enron has been giving $10,000 annually to the Law & Organizational Economics Center for several years for their programs providing economic education to state judges.  I have been following the program and have been impressed by the quality of presentations and professors lecturing to state officials on such things as opportunity cost, cost/benefit analysis, and risk analysis.  Many of these judges have not had much training in economics.

Attached is a note from Henry Butler about moving his program from the University of Kansas to Chapman University, which was due to an additional financial support and a better location for operations.  A spreadsheet at the bottom shows the total number of state judges who have gone through his program since it began in the mid-1990s by state.

I have recommended to the Enron Foundation (Misha Siegel and Elyse Kalmans) that we renew the support in 2002.  You opinion might be asked as well, so I wanted to provide this to you.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Rob:

I've attached two documents:

First, an Excel Spreadsheet listing the number of judicial participants by
court and state. We do not ask the judges for their political affiliations.
In many states, the judges are elected in "nonpartisan" elections -- of
course, it is usually pretty clear who is what.  I imagine that there is a
"selection bias" toward more conservative judges -- however, even if there
is such a bias, our programs are still very valuable when in comes to making
our civil justice system more predictable.  Even the pro-business judges
need to understand how to articulate the economic reasoning that supports
their pro-business instincts.  We provide them with the tools to be more
effective.

Second, a generic description of Chapman from their P.R. office.  Rest
assured, the church does not play a major role in the University.

Also, I wanted to mention to you a significant connection between Chapman
University and Enron.  The most important player at Chapman is George L.
Argyros.  George is Chairman of the Board of Trustees and a very loyal
financial supporter of the University.  I will be Dean of the George L.
Argyros School of Business and Economics.  George has been nominated by
President Bush as Ambassador to Spain.

George Argyros is also Chairman Emeritus & Treasurer of the Horatio Alger
Association.  Kenneth L. Lay is Executive Vice President of the Horatio
Alger Association.

I suspect that Mr. Argyros and Mr. Lay have worked closely in their
leadership capacities with the Horatio Alger Association.

I would hope that this connection would result in a much larger contribution
to the Chapman LOEC.  Do you have any suggestions about how to proceed?

Checks should be made payable to "Chapman LOEC" and sent to me at the
address below.

Thanks for Enron's support.

Hope all is well with you.

Sincerely,

Henry

Jim - An update on the Owenreagh Power Partners letter that you received and forwarded to me for handling.  It appears from the below emails that it is a problem getting an auditor to prepare the accounts.  However I was informed that the file date has been extended to 12/31.  The following message re the file date is from Debbie Pritt: 

"FYI - I just spoke with Janet of Companies House and verified with her that the Form 233 I submitted is to extend the 2001 filing date from 10/31 to 12/31.  She indicated that this 14 month filing period will be approved and that all subsequent filings will be for the period ended 12/31."

I'll keep you informed as I hear more info.

Well, Gordon and I are certainly stunned!  D&T has refused to do the audit.  Gordon knows a UK Chartered Accountant located here in Houston so he is trying to contact him.  We are exploring any options at this time.

I'm attaching a copy of Azurix's Request for Arbitration with ICSID in Washington relating to Azurix Buenos Aires.  The claim should be formally registered (i.e., cleared as valid for jurisdicitional purposes) today or early next week.

 

King and Spalding put together a summary of the various themes to emphasize in the arbitration.  Much of it is quotations from provincial officials, in official reports or to the press, demonstrating the political nature of the Province's decisions.  This should give you a flavor of our case.

On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding "Peer Group Mapping".  This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any comments 
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.

Dave Delainey



Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

Mr. Derrick,

I met with Robert Taylor this week at your residence and had a very productive meeting.  One question that came up was the use of security cameras.  Areas that we discussed using cameras were:

Gate at Larchmont
Driveway gate

Please let me know if that is something that you are interested in or would like to discuss.

thanks Alan

I'll pursue this possibility.  This is a very cool "face-to-face"
conferencing technology, which, instead of a video image on a screen,
projects a more-or-less holographic image of a person into the
conference room (or auditorium) itself, allowing the "virtual" person to
look the people actually in the room in the eye, and vice versa.

Hi Jim,

I enjoyed spending the afternoon with you today revising the Dallas
Council on World Affairs' Bylaws (really).

One of the hats I wear here at the Center for American and International
Law (until a few months ago known as the Southwestern Legal Foundation),
in addition to Vice President, is Director of the Center's Institute for
Transnational Arbitration (ITA).

ITA is a membership-based division of the Center.  It proudly counts
among its 175 members many of the leading international arbitrators,
counsel and firms in the world.  It is, I understand, the premier such
organization in the world.

Each year in June the ITA presents a Workshop in connection with its
annual membership meetings in Dallas, customarily at the Westin
Galleria.  Customarily the Workshop includes a mock arbitration,
presented in a series of scenes acted out by prominent international
arbitrators and counsel.  The idea is that we not only educate and
discuss, but also demonstrate, how important issues and procedures are
typically dealt with in international arbitration proceedings.  Our 2001
Workshop drew over 240 ITA members, faculty and other attendees from
over 40 countries.

Our theme for the 2002 Workshop will address technology in arbitration.
We intend not only to address technology-related legal issues, but to
demonstrate how technology is (or might) change the way international
arbitration is conducted in this digital age.

We hope to co-sponsor the 2002 Workshop with the Center's brand new
Institute for Law and Technology, another membership-based division of
the Center of which I am also the Director.

My question to you is this:  Might you and your company see this
assembly of prominent arbitration and technology lawyers from around the
globe as a good marketing opportunity for your holographic imaging
product?  What I'd love to do is present one lecture or one mock scene
via your product, demonstrating to all what seems to me to be the
cutting-edge of videoconferencing today.

Well?

David

In connection with the Section 5.21 (formerly Section 5.21) disclosure, attached are two pieces of information about ECT Strategic Value Corp. (I understand that 100% of the common stock is still owned by ENA) that I have received today from Stephen Douglas and Morris Clark of the ENA Tax Group. Let me know if you need any additional information about this company. ECT Strategic Value Corp.was formed in 1996, and I understand it is still in existence. Steve (office: 713-853-0938/cell: 713-817-5052) would be the best person to talk to further about this potential disclosure issue. Keep in mind that that Liabilities (essentially poor credit quality contract receivables) were transferred to ESVC in 1996.

dear c & j~~~~the following FYI is based on hours of research i did out of the goodness and generosity of my [IMAGE] in preparation of our " Griswalds do NY Christmas 2001."  of course you can thank me later but for now here are some suggestions :
              date:    dec. 22-dec.27
      Having reviewed several (and i do mean several) hotels the Park Lane seems to be the most reasonable. (yes, we are looking at the economics of this adventure[IMAGE]) (rooms vs. suites)  this would mean reserving 5 rooms (car and jim; jan and bob; hol and tan; jim and cor; jo-jo).  room rates:  standard:  park view $251.00  city view $  205.00         play suggestions (based on seeing 3 plays; one on broadway; one off broadway and the radio city music hall christmas show)   on:   the producers   or   aida;    off:  blueman troop;  and radio city xmas show.  
          on broad: $230   off:  150   radio c m  $150
             after reviewing, please adivse either by phone or mail as to the next step.  i suggest we reserve our room accommodations, theatre tickets, plane reservations etc. ASAP[IMAGE]     keep in mind that what you have just reviewed is open
to discussion and any and all suggestions you elves might have.   upon finalizing our plans i will provide trip agendas for all good little boys and girls~~~~sorry jim, i guess you'll have to look on with carrin[IMAGE]             x0x0x0x0x0[IMAGE] jdg

Good Afternoon

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

regards

Ed  

Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice. 
NOTE I would really like to complete this by Wednesday this week as this is my last week.

CONFIDENTIAL, PRIVILEDGED ATTORNEY-CLIENT
COMMUNICATION...rob and bruce. i read yesterday the
erc of 1998 yesterday as well as the indian solicitors
opinions, and most of the regs. i am out of town for a
couple of days and i just wanted to give you my
reactions....1. i feel that we would not prevail on
our jurisdiction arguments were we before a u.s.
court. the law is too well established against us
here. i am coming from having been involved in both
the contract modification point in various fpc/ferc
cases including the order 380 cases that overturned
all the pipeline contracts and the gulf warranty/texas
eastern case that disregarded the arbitration
provision of the gulf warranty contract in favor of
fpc review. so i confess, i would be hard to convince.
2. we are positing a rather narrow interpretation of
the dispute resolution authority, e.g. no jurisdiction
for disputes between "utilities". will the h.c.
interpret the mrc for all future cases as withholding
jurisdiction or disputes between utilities? the point
of all this negativism is that we consider trying to
avoid the risk of an up or down decision by the h.c.
(obviously, we may not be able to do so and some
probably will not wish to do so), suggesting
alternatively to the court that it e.g. permit the ppa
arbitration to go forward, deferring to a future date
the jurisdiction determination. in one of our
discussions chris mentioned this as a strategy. there
are no doubt other imaginative options. i, of course,
defer to chris and the indian counsel, who believe
merc has no jurisdiction, but this regluatory issue is
new to them and old to u.s. public service companies
and me, so i would question them thoroughly to be sure
they have focussed on the risks. an adverse finding by
merc could effect our political risk coverage. we
might quietly ask our coverage expert how an adverse
merc finding on the misrep issue would effect our
protection. 3.  a couple of comments on today's
meeting...i am concerned that any hint or threat of a
lender liability claim would produce a claim against
us, not a valid one, but one we don't want. secondly i
would use bankrupcy as a last resort to save our
having to put more into the project. clearly others
know much better than i, but i don't see us salvaging
any equity money from a bankrupcy and i don't see the
indian courts or merc honoring a u.s. court order. for
whatever value or use, if any, they may be, these are
my views, which i reserve the right to change. jim

Gentlemen --

A busy day in India that is likely to generate substantial press.

MSEB sent us 2 letters stating that there will be no Phase II performance testing, MSEB will not pay any further amounts under the PPA and MSEB will draw no further power from Dabhol.  MSEB requested that DPC stop providing availability declarations.  These letters turn the vague "recission" letter that we received last week into a more concrete repudiation by MSEB.

On Friday, MSEB filed a 120 page petition with the Maharashtra Energy Regulatory Commission seeking relief on a number of issues.  MSEB's position seems to be that because they are no longer bound by the PPA, that the MERC is the appropriate regulatory body to regulate the MSEB/DPC relationship (e.g., determine the price for power and the amount owed by DPC on the misdeclaration claim).  The MERC ruled today that it likely has jurisdiction in this matter and granted some interim relief to MSEB (including stopping any arbitration proceedings by DPC against MSEB).  We are preparing a petition tor the Bombay High Court to overturn the MERC's actions.

The Government of India continues to state publicly that it will not buy power from Dabhol.  Accordingly, we have existing counterparties (MSEB and GOM) that do not want Dabhol's power and are not creditworthy and no reasonable hope at present to find other viable counterparties.

Bruce

 -----Original Message-----

Subject:	Weekend Update/Next Week Thoughts

Here is an update plus my thoughts on what we should consider this week. I hope to be able to discuss this on Monday's call. As this involves some press updates and thoughts regarding the lenders, I am sending this to Ben and Ranabir as well..

I. Press Reports in Weekend Newspapers after Friday Renegotiating Meeting -- reports were mixed on Renegotiation Meeting and possibility of success to find a solution. 

More Credible papers:
Times of India: DPC Phase II should be scrapped, panel tells Enron
Economic Times: Enron panel meet fails to make breakthrough; State weighs termination notice to DPC

Other papers who follow DPC closely:
Financial Express: DPC to meet panel on May 23; Renegotiation is only way out for DPC; Cut in tariff likely
Business Standard: Dabhol not averse to tariff renegotiation

So the press is all over the map on the outcome of Friday's meeting.


II. Press reports from Delhi with GOI reaction:

Summary: GOI hopeful that solution can be found between DPC and GOM
BUT: GOI makes clear in Sunday papers the GOI position: While GOI not opposed to allowing DPC power sale to 3rd parties, neither GOI nor NTPC will purchase power from DPC.


III. MESSAGE TO LENDERS:  Lenders want to know we are serious about finding solutions. We are, and are willing to engage in dialogue so long as willing buyers of power are at table. This was made clear in Friday's meeting. But Renegotiating Committee is not serious about realistic solutions. Evidence of this is Chairman's view that DPC (and thus its lenders and shareholders) should get no recovery for the LNG infrastructure. Rather, he strongly believes tariff should be (as reported in Godbole Committee Report) the lowest of any gas-based power plant in country, including those few with pipeline gas. Second, GOI is not serious yet, as they did not even bother to send someone to meeting. 


IV. STEPS FORWARD (for consideration)

A. Issue PTN (whether to do it with or without Transfer Notice to be discussed separately on Monday)

B. When PTN issued, press statement to be issued to cover --
after several months of meetings and proposals, no serious response by MSEB, GOM and GOI
parties are still not meeting their contractual obligations, even after both Indian and int'l lenders have written to GOI
thus we are taking steps to protect contractual rights by issuing PTN
Regarding future meetings to discuss project: 
project was designed as baseload to meet MSEB requirements and approved by GOM and GOI; project must have buyers for power to have serious negotiations
Renegotiating Committee position, which is reiteration of Godbole Committee report, is unrealistic 
If MSEB, GOM and GOI are not willing to meet their contractual obligations to offtake power, then not feasible to discuss any changes to deal; thus prior to any further meetings, DPC awaits specific proposal from MSEB/GOM/GOI on who they propose to substitute for MSEB as the party who is contractually obligated to purchase the power from DPC
the prior point is important in that we need to (a) set the going forward agenda with respect to any further meetings and (b) manage expectations regarding such future meetings and who will deliver what proposals, if any (not us).

C. Bring in senior management ASAP after PTN
Rationale is to both feed our ideas into the GOI as well let lenders know we are committed to finding solution, including bringing our senior management to India for meetings
I recommend we bring Ken Lay with Rebecca to meet in Delhi with Prime Minister, Finance Minister and Power Minister, along with Sonia Gandhi. Other meetings can be scheduled as well, and we will want to include some add'l meetings in Delhi and Mumbai. But above are the key meetings.
Key message to be delivered -- 2 [or 3] options face the project
Terminate, and we are willing to go that route rather than have to invest significant additional money into a project in the India power sector that does not currently work
Buyout of foreign debt and equity and allow an Indian solution to be found
[Renegotiate on our terms, including GOI taking 2 power blocks and IFIs funding all additional project costs. My earlier e-mail on renegotiation possibilities might provide some ideas here.] The reason I mention this option here is that if we ever think we might have to table a renegotiation option, having Ken & Rebecca do it at the highest level is the way to go. 
The solution, regardless of which of 3 options will be chosen, must be handled at the highest level, and I think it is now (right after PTN) or never to bring in Ken and Rebecca to see if the solution is there as well as let our lenders know we are seriously taking one more run to try and find a solution. After we bring in Ken and Rebecca, if the GOI still remains on the sidelines and does not step up, the Phase I lenders should realize we have done everything we can and give us the Transfer Notice approval. The quicker we bring in Ken and Rebecca, the quicker we should have the strongest argument for the Transfer Notice approval.

One logistical point: I do think it is very important to bring in Ken and Rebecca very quickly after the PTN is issued.  But we will need some advance time to set up these high level meetings as well as get Indian approvals to bring Ken's plane into India. This will take about a full business week, so I think we should schedule this trip as soon as we can -- perhaps during week of May 21. 

D. At same time as senior management comes in, have senior contacts from Wash. DC contact political leaders in Delhi to request a solution be found quickly to avoid any implications on improving India/US relations

E. Finally, I also think it is time for Enron to strongly consider an approach directly to some possible buyers. There are 2 Indian corporates who would be leading candidates. There are also some international majors that would be possible. Enron could consider a joint asset package of:
DPC
Metgas (the TARA is the real value here)
Depending on the appropriate Enron internal approvals, 2 other assets could be considered
Offshore oil & gas assets
Data center

On the last 2 items, I know that one of the Indian corporates would be interested in the oil & gas assets, and both would be interested in the data center.

We could arrange meetings with senior management of potential purchasers when Ken & Rebecca are in India (or, to avoid press, we might want to schedule these either in low-key India locations or even outside India (Dubai or Singapore)).

We can discuss these thoughts on Monday.
Wade

Our friend and former partner, Hugh McIntosh, completed his degree at the
Harvard Divinity School and was ordained to the ministry on June 3, 2001 at
the North-Prospect United Church of Christ in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In
the program for the service, he expressed great appreciation to his partners
and friends at Vinson & Elkins for "their wisdom, professionalism and
support which built the foundation for the future."

Hugh and Sara will soon move to Hawaii, where Hugh will be a chaplain at the
Punahou School.

I am attaching a picture of Hugh following the service, and hope that you
enjoy it.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

I believe that the Resolutions No. 4, 6 and 9 are not correct in terms of the text:

1. resolution no. 4 is not correct since the S.Board did not review the new (attached) changes to the budget and did not approve it. There was also an amandement to the text of the Resolution re. the line items and the total amounts exeeding the approved budget.	

I believe that the draft Budget with the new amendemends must be reviewed once again as a whole at the next Sup.Board meeting before it can be enacted.

2. Resoltuions No. 6 and 9 - the vote descritpion is not correct

Regards - Jarek

David and Jim:

I spoke with Joe Hubach today and he is very interested in becoming a part of the new Tech Law Center.  Joe is expecting your call, Jim, and David you might want to follow up and invite him to lunch.  He said he would do his best to attend the ICLC Advisory Board meeting and the Symposium this year, too (no doubt mainly to hear Jim's talk!)

I don't have Jim's or Robby's email address.  Steph, will you forward this to  
them along with the attached. 
I get the impression that from time to time different law firms court Enron  
to obtain a significant portion of the company's legal work. 
The attached paper which I received from my subscription to Law.com,

Subject:	Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation


As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

I want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer Analyst or Associate work on your team. I also want to remind everyone what a high stakes activity this is for Enron.
Based on your recommendation, we will make offers at the end of the summer to those interns who perform, and who you endorse as a potential future member of your team. Those interns who have had a good experience and accept our offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source. We will have effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months. They also have the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have, when they return to campus. On the flip side, those who don't have meaningful assignments, or have bad experiences during the summer can severely hurt our efforts.
Thank you again for being part of this very important activity. If you have any questions, or if areas of concern arise during the summer, please contact Ted Bland (x35275), Traci Warner (x33242) or me (x36671).
We appreciate your contributions to this important effort for Enron. 
Billy

Milberg Weiss has filed a shareholder derivative suit against Sprint's directors and officers in connection with the failed Sprint-WorldCom merger. Yesterday, the Missouri state court judge denied our motion to dismiss for failure to make a demand first on the Sprint board of directors. The Sprint board has now established a special litigation committee, which will investigate the allegations and make a report and recommendation to the court.
As you may know, special litigation committees rely heavily on independent counsel for conducting the investigation and writing reports.
The selection of independent counsel is made by the special litigation committee. However, because the committee is unaware of counsel who do this type of work, I am writing to solicit any recommendations you may have. If your board of directors has used a special litigation committee, and you believe that independent counsel had the requisite experience to get the job done in a timely, complete and professional manner, I would appreciate a reply to this message. If you were impressed, please let me know the name of the firm and principal attorney.
Thanks and best regards,

It looks like an Oregonian investigative reporter is trying to  put a story together suggesting that our management advised  employees that they should be investing in Enron stock through  their 401Ks (see attached note from our public affairs).   
 
Jim (or Rob), should we be conferring with Enron defense  counsel on this, and if so who?  dn

Jeff Manning at The Oregonian called to say tomorrow's newspaper will have  another report on the Enron 401(k) problems, and the connection to PGE through  the details of three lawsuits. I said nothing new, but did clarify a quote that  had appeared from PGE in the previous story Manning wrote.
 
I've copied Doug on this because the issue is getting more serious.  Manning informed me that The Oregonian has now assigned him and Gail Hill  to "charge ahead and do more on this story." They want to sit down with HR and  review documentation that proves that we have provided financial planning  counsel, that we have provided information about diversifying portfolios, etc.  This is strongly leaning in the legal area, and we would like to have  counsel before saying anything further. We can't expect much cover from Enron,  either: Manning vented to me about how no one there will return his calls.
 
Carol, Gail, Kregg and I can be available to meet early tomorrow to discuss  how to move ahead on this. Doug, let us know if sometime before noon might work  for you. Thanks.

We'll save:  

Annual Renewals: $25,000
Library Rent:         $10,000  ( $25 x 400 sift free up approx. 400 sift for office space)
Labor Cost:           $  9,600  ( 40 hrs. a month, $20 an hour)
____________________________________________________
Total:                    $44,600

We'll enjoy higher discount and benefit more from our current flat rate contracts with Lexis and Westlaw if internet and online services are our only options.   Lexis is set as $55 per ID per month for unlimited usage.  We have 175 users in Legal, pay about $9,625 while our actual usage is $35,000 - $40,000 a month.  Westlaw is set at $8,000 a month for usage up to $16,000 a month.  We pay $8,000 - $9,000 to Westlaw while our usage is about $14,000 a month.  

Best of all, federal and state statues and rules are more current with government and state websites and on Lexis/Westlaw than printed books.  I have custom weblinks of Lexis and Westlaw on our portal.  Trainings are offered to let folks to see how we have made search Lexis and Westlaw so easy.  My goal is moving us towards a virtual library.  

I've not gotten any objections with my weeding proposal.  I'll wait to Tuesday, 5/22 to proceed with my plan.  I welcome your suggestions and advice.


Have a nice weekend!

rob, this sould be of interest.  the mseb petition was
well done, not what we are accustomed to seeing. on
its face, it is troublesome, but as christopher notes,
there are very good legal and factual defenses. i will
bring you a copy of the misrepresentiation part on
monday. jim

Jim,

Sorry for the delay in my response.

As you may imagine things are starting to get a little fraught. I assume
that someone has supplied you with a copy of the MSEB's Peition to MERC (the
main text and pleading is 56 pages only,the rest consisting of exhibits).

My points in reply as follows:-

(1) The MSEB's claim for recission is,in my humble opinion,utterly hopeless
for the following reasons:-

(a) The MSEB has know that the Power Station could not do the required
ramp-up in a cold start for nearly 2 years during which time performance (of
a sort) has been tendered by the MSEB. The MSEB affirmed the contract many
months ago.

(b) The Lenders took rights in security over the PPA bona fide and for
value. That,as a matter of settled law,bars recission.

(c) I do not believe that there was any "representation" as such.

(2) The Dynamic Parameters of the Plant form the exhibits to the PPA. If
they are anything,they are warranties or promises,not representations. The
classical definition of a warranty in English law is a pre-contractual
representation which has been reduced to writing and inserted into the
resulting contract. As such,it takes effect as a promise.

(3) I think that the MERC Petition in fact tells one how the MSEB is putting
its case on misrepresentation. Effectively,it is saying that DPC put forward
a draft contract with the Dynamic Parameters in it,and we relied upon them;
they induced us to enter into the contract. That is a bit of a summary,but
it is roughly their case. The advantage to DPC of the MERC Petition (if DPC
is ever allowed to arbitrate) is that we know what he MSEB's defence is
going to be before we even plead out Statement of Claim.

(4) What you are describing is a request for further and better particulars
of the MSEB's pleading. Standing the fact that DPC is challenging the
jurisdiction of MERC,DPC cannot safely ask for anything in that proceeding.
We can ask by letter. I doubt whether we would ever get a reply. What we may
well get,however,is something further by way of filings made by the MSEB in
the proposed Wirt Petition.

If you do not get a copy of the MSEB Petition filed with the MERC,please let
me know.

chris, i would like to have your thoughts of this
misrepresentation claim. i have not seen the mseb
petition before the merc, which i hear (but do not
believe) contains 700 pages. all i have seen is the
very generalized "you misrepresented" statement in
their letter. what would you think of asking in some
appropriate correspondence-- what was/were the
misrepresentation/s referred to, when were they made,
who made them, to whom, were they in writing or oral
(if in writing, what writings) etc. in other words pin
them down. this is what we would do if confronted with
a similar broad, general charge in a court proceeding.
it might make the mseb think more and prepare better,
but they may not have anything other than their
interpretation of the ppa. please give me your direct
line again. i have not had much luck calling the 24888
number. best regards, jim

James

Given Whalley's promotion, it looks like the Xcelerator will remain under Corporate, rather than moving to EWS as expected when we last spoke.  Given that change, would you like for me to continue to request support from Mark Haedicke's group or is there someone in the corporate area you'd rather I approach.  Whatever route you suggest is fine with me.

Most pressingly, I'd like to discuss our ability to compete with a company with which we've been in discussions -- if possible by the latter part of the week.

Thank you.

Hello Jim,
I just want to keep you up on the situation with  our office spaces in Jones Hall. The Civic Center will be going to City Council  this week to ask for monies to rebuild the SPA and Symphony offices, and the  rehearsal hall, music library, instrument storage, etc.  If approved, I'm  told the City will allow us to have the offices rebuilt by the contractor of our  choice.  We will want the contractor who originally built our offices 6 or  7 years ago. However, the rebuild will take between 10 and 12 weeks.  That  means we will not return to offices until, say, end of February, assuming some  work will be accomplished in December.
We told Enron that we should return to Jones Hall  by the end of this year; obviously that won't happen. Of course, we would want  to remain in our present offices on the 37th floor of Three Allen Center until  the end of February.  But, is this possible?  Do you have any idea  what might happen to your space here, and whether we can remain?  Shall we  remain quiet, hoping nobody notices us?  Let me know, please, if there is  anything I can do to remain in these offices. Thanks

I attach a revised draft of the Writ Petition.  This is in its final form
subject to a final read through for typos (I am aware of the small glitch
with the paragraph numbering which is beyond my rudimentary typing skills)
and reformatting into legal size.  I will arrange for this to be done at our
open of business Wednesday and I expect to be able to forward a final
version of the document to Bombay by 8:30am Bombay time.  I should be
grateful if DPC would see to the few figures that still need to be inserted
into the draft.

You will note that we have removed the reference to the PPA as an exhibit to
the petition.  Exhibiting the PPA would, in our view, make the petition
unnecessarily bulky.  In any event the relevant provisions of the PPA are
set out in the PPA itself.

If you have any questions in relation to the draft, please let me know.

Kind regards
Andrew House

Dad,
As far as I know I will be coming back to the States around July 1. My last
day of school is June 23. I can?t say that I am looking forward to leaving
Madrid. It really takes a long time to become acclimated in a city like
Madrid. They say Its Like New York the first year is tough, but after a year
you can?t leave. I think I know how Woody Allen feels about the Island of
Manhattan. I realize though that my time here is coming to an end and I know
that I will cherish the memories of the good times and bad times resulting
in my 9 months here in Madrid. I really appreciate you giving me this
opportunity. I think it has been a very positive experience. love  Son.

I agree with your proposal - this is probably the best we could do anyway.

I think you have done a piece of good but frustrating work there.

Subject: FW: ENS - Draft Form of Acceptance


Good Afternoon

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

regards

Ed  

Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice. 
NOTE I would really like to complete this by Wednesday this week as this is my last week.

Jim, I promised you some contact details.

Although I'm a little late with formal notification, as from the beginning of
the year I joined Societe Generale on a part-time basis.  I'm a Senior
International Adviser which means I do pretty much anything I want to turn my
hand to.  Jay Worenklein, who's the Global Head of Project Finance in New York,
is an old friend and we have always said that it would be fun to work together
if the opportunity ever arose.

In parallel with the SG role, I am continuing with the two roles for the British
Government I had previously mentioned to you: as adviser to the Deputy Prime
Minister and the Minister of Transport on the use of private finance in the
transport sector, and as non-executive Deputy Chairman of Partnerships UK, the
new merchant bank cum project developer the Government has formed to take
forward its well-known private finance programme.  So you can see that I've
finally ended up with the sort of portfolio we were discussing last fall.

Contact details are as follows:

Mobile              44 7802 655 605

At Partnerships UK  44 20 7273 8341 (direct)
               44 20 7273 8357 (my personal secretary - Carole James- who can
usually be relied upon to know where I am)
               44 20 7273 8383 (switch)
               44 20 7273 8367     (fax)
               e-mail:  adrian.montague@partnershipsuk.org.uk

At Societe Generale 44 20 7676 6821 (direct)
               44 20 7676 6881 (Nicola White - who tends to now where I am when
I'm at SG, or is a good point of call if Carole is not there)
               44 30 7676 6000 (switch)
               44 20 7667 2487 (fax)
               e-mail: as above

Since I move between offices a fair amount, if you send an e-mail, it's best to
send to both addressed at once.

All the best

Adrian

NOTICES TO REFINERIES SAID TO INDICATE NEW SOURCE REVIEW
MOVING FORWARD

Notices of violation sent to two major oil companies by EPA
indicate the agency is moving forward with enforcement of
the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. The
agency sends notices of violation to ExxonMobil Oil Corp.,
and Sunoco Inc., for allegedly making major improvements at
refineries in Louisiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas
without installing modern pollution-control equipment. The
notices inform the companies that EPA has detected alleged
violations and represent the first formal step in an
enforcement action. They come as the agency is completing
work on an examination ordered by the White House of new
source review enforcement and its effects on oil refining
and electricity production. Industry and environmental
groups were bracing for release of the EPA new source review
report in December, but agency sources now say the report is
likely to be released in January 2002. . . . Page A-1

REVISED EPA INVENTORY UPDATE RULE NOT READY FOR REPORTS DUE
IN 2002

A final, revised Inventory Update Rule that would change the
information chemical manufacturers and importers provide EPA
will not be issued in time for the 2002 reporting cycle,
according to William Sanders, director of EPA's Office of
Pollution Prevention and Toxics. He says EPA is still
developing a final rule which it intends to submit to the
White House Office of Management and Budget in 2002. The
Inventory Update Rule forms required for 2002 will contain
the same types of information EPA requested in 1998. . . .

ADMINISTRATION REVOKES RULE LINKING FEDERAL CONTRACTS TO
COMPLIANCE

The Bush administration revokes the rule issued during the
Clinton administration that linked the award of federal
contracts to a contractor's compliance with labor, tax, and
environmental laws. Several federal agencies, including EPA,
argued the rule would damage the procurement process. . . .

SUGGESTED REFORMS FOR PERMITS INCLUDES INDUSTRY ROLE WRITING
APPLICATIONS

A report from Resources for the Future suggests Congress
consider amending the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act,
and other environmental laws to make companies responsible
for writing permits required by the regulations.  Among
other things, the report finds permit applications often
require more information than needed. . . . Page A-2

OHIO STORAGE FACILITY WOULD PAY $400,000 IN PENALTIES UNDER
SETTLEMENT

Operators of an Ohio facility would pay $400,000 in fines
for certain hazardous waste violations under a proposed
consent decree. Under the proposed agreement, operators of
the waste storage facility, Clean Harbors Inc. in
Cincinnati, also must change certain procedures. . . . Page

DRAFT U.K. STANDARDS PUBLISHED FOR REFRIGERATORS CONTAINING
CFCS

The United Kingdom publishes draft standards for handling
discarded refrigerators that would require handlers to
remove insulation foam made from ozone-depleting substances
before scrapping or recycling the units. The draft standards
concern the removal of chlorofluorocarbons and
hydrochlorofluorocarbons from the cooling system and the
insulating foam. They follow the introduction of a European
Union directive banning the disposal of refrigerators unless
all the CFCs and HCFCs have been removed. . . . Page A-6

Gail,

Andrew Rogers QC called me from Jakarta an hour or so ago to say that he had
reached agreement (by telephone) with Quentin Loh SC (the GOM's arbitrator)
that Lord Mustill should be appointed as the presiding arbitrator in each of
the 3 arbitrations between DPC and the GOM.

A letter will come out of Lord Mustill's Clerk confirming his acceptance of
the appointment. That will probably appear from London tommorrow.

The next round of conversations to be undertaken by Andrew Roger QC will be
with Mr Justice Pendse in relation to the arbitration between DPC and the
MSEB.

I attach Lord Mustill's curriculum vitae. Although Mustill is a busy man,I
think that his appointment is to be welcomed. Mustill was and is a
commercial lawyer to his fingertips. At the bar his practice was one
involving applied contract law (dry
shipping,commodities,insurance,reinsurance and banking,very much a
traditional Commercial Court practice). Along with Stewart Boyd QC he wrote
the standard text on the law of arbitration. Mustill's reputation as a judge
and an arbitrator is a strong one. His only drawback is that he is popular
arbitrator in London,and,for that reason,he is busy.

Can I ask that you circulate Lord Mustill's curriculum vitae to whoever
ought to receive it within the sponsors' group

Hold the Date: November 28, 2001

Place:  Institute for International Economics
1750 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC

Speakers:

Under Secretary of State Alan Larson
Under Secretary of Commerce Grant Aldonas

IIE Director Fred Bergsten
TI Chairman Peter Eigen

Transparency International USA is pleased to invite you to a Private Sector
Luncheon Briefing on November 28, 2001, from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. in
Washington, DC.  Our speakers from the Administration will be Under Secretary
of State Alan Larson and Under Secretary of Commerce Grant Aldonas.  IIE
Director Fred Bergsten has generously offered to host this event and will
share his views on the continuing importance of the fight against corruption.
 TI Chairman Peter Eigen will bring participants up to date on the growth of
the TI global network.

TI is playing a key role in the monitoring process designed to assure
enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.  With the economic downturn,
effective enforcement is now even more critical to dissuade those who would
use bribes to secure business.  With US attention turned to mounting a global
coalition to address the terrorist attacks of September 11, we must redouble
our efforts to ensure that the Administration and the Hill provide adequate
political and financial resources for the anti-corruption agenda.

The private sector must continue to play a central role in this effort. This
timely and important meeting will provide a forum for the private sector to
share its views with policy makers.  We will also devote time to a frank and
informal discussion of TI-USA priorities and how to meet the challenges
ahead.

Please let us know if you plan to join us.

Hello Mr. Derrick:

It was a pleasure talking to you yesterday about our yoga classes, it was very interesting hearing your opinion about the Power Yoga!

I also mentioned to you that I am running a marathon in Hawaii on December 9.  I am running on behalf of Sarah, a cute 10 year old girl that has arthritis since she was 18 months old and she hasn't been able to be a normal kid.  If you don't mind I would like to ask you if you will be so kind to sponsor me with a small donation to this worthy organization.  I actually, committed to collect $3,800 for them to be able to run de marathon and I was doing so great that I almost had it made, but today when we received the email about no more matching donations put me a little bit behind. 

Please let me know and I could send Joey to pick up the donation.  If not, please don't feel bad, I understand we are going through very hard times lately.

Thank you so much, Mr. Derrick and I will be seeing you at the yoga class if you can make it on Saturday.

Candy  :  )

James: I hope you were not offended when I wrote to you directly several
weeks ago (without introduction) about my hopes to talk to you about a
transactional lawyer position on your team.  Might you need another
hardworking, big firm trained lawyer with lots of complex outsourrcing and
transactional experience?  I think my training and experience would suit me
well to hit the ground running. I would be thrilled with the chance to
talk. Let me know and I can resend my resume. Look forward to talking soon.

Jim -

Have you received any feedback from your general counsel group?  Or, would it be helpful at this point to meet with anyone else at Enron, to at least make the personal connection?

Thanks again for your interest.

HIGHLIGHTS

SENATE BILL WOULD EXCLUDE FROM INCOME TAX AMOUNTS RECEIVED
IN PAYMENT OF DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) introduces legislation to
exclude from taxable income awards received in judgment or
settlement for claims of discrimination or violation of
civil rights. The Civil Rights Tax Relief Act of 2001 also
would eliminate the double taxation of attorneys' fees under
contingency fee agreements and allow income averaging for
back pay and front pay awarded for discrimination claims. A
companion bill is pending in the House.

The legislation would correct an unintended consequence of
the 1996 Small Business Job Protection Act, which made
damage awards that are not based on physical injury or
physical sickness taxable to the plaintiff. "Because most
acts of employment discrimination and civil rights
violations do not cause physical injuries, this provision
has had a direct and negative impact on plaintiffs who
successfully prove that they have been subjected to
intentional employment discrimination or other intentional
violations of their civil rights," Collins explains. . . .

NLRB ADOPTS BRIGHT-LINE RULE FOR DECERTIFICATION ELECTIONS,
PROHIBITS INCUMBENT UNIONS FROM USING NONEMPLOYEES AS
OBSERVERS

The National Labor Relations Board adopts a "bright-line
rule" prohibiting incumbent labor organizations from using
their nonemployee agents as election observers for
decertification elections. The board overturns a
decertification election despite the lack of any evidence of
misconduct by the union agent, citing neutrality of the
election process as the reason for its bright-line rule.

The board distinguishes decertification elections from
initial representation elections, in which nonemployee union
observers are allowed providing the agency does not engage
in misconduct and the agent's presence does not interfere
with any party's rights. "In our view, it is more likely
that an employee would be influenced by the presence of a
person who is an agent of a union that "is" his bargaining
representative than by a person who is an agent of a union
that wishes to "become" the bargaining representative." . .

FTC CLEARS AMAZON'S REVISED PRIVACY POLICY,  APPROVES
TRUSTE'S COPPA SAFE HARBOR PROGRAM

The Federal Trade Commission concludes that a change in
Amazon.com's online privacy policy concerning the
circumstances in which the company might disclose personal
information about its customers does not violate the FTC
Act. The FTC's conclusions are in response to a petition
alleging that the electronic retailer deceived consumers in
its representations about privacy of personal information. .
. . Page 2743

The Federal Trade Commission approves the safe harbor
program for children's online data proposed by TRUSTe, an
organization that grants privacy seals to Web sites. Firms
adhering to guidelines established by TRUSTe will be
presumed to be in compliance with regulations implementing
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which require
that Web sites directed at children post comprehensive
privacy policies on their sites and obtain parental consent
before collecting personal information from children under
the age of 13.  . . . Page 2744

Jim,

Well, you finally gave a speech that topped the one you gave at Linda's and my rehearsal dinner.  You did an outstanding job (as did Carrin), and it was obvious you were speaking from the heart.  I know you would prefer not to have all of this attention, but it comes with the territory.  It sure made me proud to see you up there, and congratulations on the accomplishment.

Scotty

	By telefax of November 21, Uriel Dutton of F&J provided a proposed waiver letter agreement for our review.  I will have copies of that proposed agreement circulated by hand-delivery and fax to all those on this list and to Mariner's GC.  At present,  I am not sending this e-mail to Mariner's GC. If there is someone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know.  

	Chuck and I have reviewed the letter, believe it to be overly broad, and hope that F&J is willing to negotiate further, along the following lines:

	1.  On page 1, third full paragraph, second line, we suggest inserting "Enron Corp. and " between "representation of" and "Enron's affiliates".

	2.  On page 4, paragraph (4), we are concerned about the third sentence, which reads as follows:  "Enron Corp. agrees that it will cause each existing or future affiliate of Enron Corp. to comply with the agreements of the Enron Entities herein set forth."  We think, although we do not know for sure, that F&J's concern is that F&J may become adverse in the future to some existing Enron entity that F&J does not currently represent,  or that does not currently exist, and that either of these two entities may seek to assert disqualification based on F&J's current representation of Enron entities.  If this is the reason for the sentence, we don't see how an existing Enron entity or future Enron entity could assert a conflict that has been waived by the Enron entity that is actually being represented.

	      We also have a concern about asking Enron Corp. to cause all of its "affiliates", as defined in the letter agreement, to comply with it.  Enron Corp. may not have the power to require all its "affiliates" to comply.  Our suggestion would be that this letter agreement be signed on behalf of all the actual Enron entities currently represented by F&J, including Mariner.

	 3.  On page 4, 17 lines from the top, we find objectionable the language that begins, "Without limiting the foregoing..."  It seems to us that here, F&J wants all the Enron companies to be considered separately for disqualification purposes, and perhaps to be able to sue one Enron entity even though F&J is representing another Enron entity in a substantially related matter.

	3. On pages 4-5, paragraph (5), we have a concern about the third sentence, which reads as follows:  "If Dynegy declines or fails to do so promptly after receipt of our request, it is expressly agreed and understood that F&J shall be entitled..."  Our concern is that we are committing Enron entities to an agreed course of action post-merger based on speculation as to what Dynegy may or may not do.  Our suggestion would be that we simply ask F&J to delete all but the first two sentences of paragraph (5).

	4.  Please note that under the terms of this proposed agreement, we are not requiring F&J to be liable for the ramp-up costs of new counsel for, e.g., the Licensing Project or the asbestosis cases (in the event that Enron Corp. cannot be dismissed from the asbestosis cases pre-trial).  We do not believe that ramp-up costs will be something F&J will agree to if we need F&J to take on the new Mariner matter.  Mariner's GC called me today to advise that it was urgent that she know today or tomorrow whether F&J was going to be able to represent Mariner on a new, critical asset-sale matter that is scheduled to close no later than December 27; otherwise, she will need to hire other counsel to handle that matter.

	Please let us have your comments as soon as possible.

	Britt

jim,  sorry i could not stay in austin for the formal "thank you" to you for your leadership this past year.  i would add "well done" and please "stay around"!

i would like to follow up on knowing whom i should contact, with your advance permission, for securing legal representation from enron corp. for the firm.  candidly does vicki sharp's position inhibit our serving in that capacity?  i know you approved us 2 years ago but we have not been contacted at all for representation.  we have turned down putative claims against enron for multiple reasons, even those where our role would not have been apparent.
 i believe we can provide cost effective, quality representation in multiple areas of expertise (see our web site at www.gpsolaw.com) and enron would be well served.  let me know your thoughts, on a confidential basis, and i will act accordingly.  i enjoyed having lunch with carrin  as well and i wish you "patience and luck" on your home remodelling.  best personal regards,   roger

this is a draft undertaking for all defendants who ask Enron to advance the
expenses of litigation.  Please let me have any comments.  while there is no
urgency for the defendants who are still associated with us, I think we
should send the undertaking to Andy's lawyer ASAP.

was there). he had a good grasp of the issues. i can
understand not understanding the misdeclaration issue.
but he has in the past been responsive. my bottom
line: i agree we need more than 1 senior advocate if
they can work together. i would hate to lose atul r.
or lose his enthusiasm--i trust satulvad completely on
the indian law. i do not know the other candidates,
but would not replace him on the basis of one
performance before the merc. finally, i would not do
anything without a personal discussion with cw. jim

Re:  Legal Update

We'd like to update you on recent developments that may be of interest to
you:

President Bush Releases His Energy Plan: On May 17, President Bush took a
large step towards addressing the nation's growing imbalance between energy
supply and demand by issuing a comprehensive report on national energy
policy. The 150+ page report contains 105 specific recommendations with
respect to all forms of energy, including natural gas, coal, oil, nuclear
and renewable energy sources. It is unknown at this time how Senator
Jeffords (VT) announcing on May 23rd a switch to independent will affect
energy legislation.

A number of proposals directly affect natural gas, including:



*	Increase funding for LIHEAP to $1.7 billion annually
*	Funnel some oil and gas royalty payments to LIHEAP when oil and
natural gas prices exceed a certain level
*	Streamline pipeline permitting processes
*	Improve pipeline safety and reliability
*	Provide tax incentives and streamlined permitting for Combined Heat
and Power
*	Establish an interagency task force under the Council on
Environmental Quality to coordinate federal agencies in expediting permits
and guide federal, state and local coordination for energy projects
*	Direct federal agencies to prepare Energy Impact Statements for
proposed actions
*	Open a portion of ANWR for exploration and production
*	Double funding for DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program
*	Increase coordination with Canada and Mexico with regard to energy
investment and infrastructure permitting

Important items not included in the White House plan are tax incentives for
natural gas exploration and production, natural gas transmission and
distribution infrastructure, natural gas vehicles and a mandate for total
energy efficiency. See attachment for side-by-side analysis. Also see
www.aga.org <http://www.aga.org/>  for additional information.

Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth Increases in Size and Influence:
During the last few weeks, more than 200 local chambers of commerce, major
trade organizations and other energy customer representatives have joined
the Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth. The 400+ member Alliance is
building consensus for a comprehensive U.S. energy strategy that balances
supply and demand without compromising environmental safeguards. Recently
during a Washington, D.C., speech, AGA's Dave Parker described that consumer
education about energy issues will play a vital role in mobilizing public
support behind a balanced approach in Congress. More material is posted on
www.yourenergyfuture.org.

Senate Banking Committee Approves Bill to Repeal PUHCA: On April 24, the
Senate Banking Committee approved by a 19-1 vote a bill (S.206) to repeal
the original 1935 PUHCA. The committee also approved three amendments. The
first would establish a five-member task force to study competition in the
wholesale and retail electricity market. The second would continue FERC's
role in requiring "reasonable" utility rates. It would also continue to
prohibit utility companies from using profits from regulated activities to
fund unregulated activities. The third amendment would direct the General
Accounting Office to study the efforts of state and federal regulators in
preventing anticompetitive practices by holding companies. The bill would
transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the Securities
and Exchange Commission to FERC. A similar bill, HR 1101, has been
introduced in the House.

Pipeline Safety, the Focus of DOT and AGA Meeting: On May 22, AGA chairman
Nick Rose and AGA's Dave Parker met with Secretary of Transportation Norman
Mineta and discussed a wide range of pipeline safety issues, including the
importance of the enactment of balanced legislation. We will provide more
information on pipeline safety legislation at the Legal Forum

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Pub. L. 106-102: By July 1, 2001 all "financial
institutions" that collect non-public personal information from consumer
customers must examine their information collection and sharing practices
and have a "privacy policy" that notifies those customers of their
distribution of that information. The regulations broadly define "financial
institutions" to include entities that are "significantly engaged," inter
alia, in lending, insuring and guaranteeing. Such activities may include
providing financing or warranty service. Regulated entities must provide
their customers with the policy and, under certain circumstances, the
ability to opt-out or prevent the entities from distributing the
information. The law does not require that all customers receive the privacy
policy - it only applies to those customers that receive the benefit of the
financial activities. Most activity by an LDC does not subject the company
to the Act. However, providing appliance financing or warranty service may
require compliance. The law, regulations and sample privacy policies can be
found at www.ftc.gov/privacy/index <http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/index> .

Subject: Re: Membership Report---Friday Meeting


In preparation for our meeting this Friday, I wanted to describe my
concerns with regard to one particular aspect of the Membership
Committee report.

The issue that I am the most concerned about is the idea of forced
rotation and limited terms on the Advisory Board.  To state up front the
conclusion I try to explain below (in what is admittedly too long of an
explanation that probably tries to anticipate too many of the likely
counter-concerns), I would favor keeping in place the part of our
current Advisory Board structure that enables key industry leaders, as
well as the same representative from a dues-paying organization, to
remain in place on the Board for as long as both (1)  they wish to
serve, and (2) they are providing sufficient personal time or financial
support, or both, to provide value to the Center.   I do not oppose the
removal of Advisory Board members who are providing neither service to
the Center nor financial support-----unless the staff of the Center
advise that the appearance on our Advisory Board list of the names of
certain key industry leaders has been of material value to the Center in
recruiting involvement of others without regard for whether the former
actually work on or financially support projects of the Center.

The underlying bias and beliefs from which my concerns arise are as
follows.  While others may have reached the opposite conclusion, I think
the "longtime" participation in the SWLF's leadership by some of the top
leaders in the oil and gas industry, without forced rotation,  has been
a key asset and has greatly benefitted the Center.  While the list of
key leaders runs much longer than this, I would note just by way of
example that Sheila Hollis, Jim Hardwick and Stuart Hollimon from the
private practice sector, Pat Martin and John Lowe from the academic
sector, and Ted Frois, Ken Dickerson and Jim Derrick from the General
Counsel sector, are some of the individuals who have occupied leadership
roles in the Foundation for about as long as I have followed its
activities closely.  One of the attributes which caused me to want to
become actively involved in this group was the observation that the SWLF
had a group of key leaders in the industry who seemed to have embraced
this organization as one in which they would make a longer term
commitment and investment.

If we had a large group of new and effective leaders who were out there
wanting to be involved in the leadership of the Center, and if the
continued participation by those who have been active for a number of
years was somehow blocking these newer people out of leadership roles,
we might have a situation that needs to be addressed.  However, the
staff of the Foundation/Center have taken the lead in making sure that
we have the opposite situation.  During the past 5 or so years, I have
seen David Ellwanger, David Winn and Mark Smith provide as much
encouragement and as much of an open door as anyone could provide, and
they have indeed made a point to aggressively recruit active
participation by those who show any inkling at all of maybe being
slightly inclined to become active in this group.  Any new players who
have wanted to become active are both encouraged to do so and are given
leadership opportunities very quickly----and much more quickly than any
other organization in which I have been involved.

Our current system is one which eagerly welcomes new participant
leaders, and the staff of the Center and a number of the Center's
leaders have been making efforts for years  to encourage participation
by new leaders.    If we have a shortage of new leaders in the Center,
it is not due to a system or organization  that discourages such
participation, because there are too many of us who have joined the
leadership in the past 5 years who can attest that this group welcomed
early leadership participation as quickly as any group in which we have
ever been involved.   Rather, any shortage of new leader participants is
due to other factors such as the declining number of oil and gas
attorneys and the need to develop program content and a broader range of
activities that will attract broader participation among  other sectors
of the energy industry that are growing instead of shrinking.

I have been involved in organizations that have had a forced rotation
and "up and out" system, and it has not worked well where there is not a
continuing supply of new people who want to work hard----not just take
on the name of the office and do nothing, but actually work hard-----in
carrying forward the initiatives of the organization.  While in theory
the former hard-working and talented leaders are still welcome to remain
active in a non-leadership capacity after they complete their cycle, the
general experience is that these leaders move on and choose to spend
their energy with other organizations that still offer them leadership
roles.

The ABA Section of Environment, Energy and Resources has an up and out
system.  John Lowe used to be the head of that Section.  John has not
been active in that group since he completed his tenure as Section
Chair, and I think the Section is worse off for it.  I expect that
Sheila Hollis, the current Chair, will be likely to greatly reduce the
portion of her energies that the ABA receives when she completes her
tenure as Chair, and the ABA will be worse off for that as well.  And
the ABA, with this system, has often had great difficulty finding energy
lawyers who are willing to take on leadership roles and really work for
the organization.  I think the ABA would be better off, at least in the
energy area, if whenever they find an energy law leader who will work
hard, they hold on to that person as long as she or he will serve, while
still finding room for service in other leadership capacities for any
new energy leaders who come along from time to time.

The "up and out" system may work in a satisfactory way for the State Bar
of Texas because the Oil, Gas and Mineral Law Section Council is
relatively small in size, and the State of Texas, uniquely, will always
have enough new oil and gas attorneys who want to have those positions
on their resume that there will always be a supply of new, hard-working
people to fill the positions of the outgoing officers of that Council.

However, I am concerned that the Center has a much more limited supply
of ongoing new, hard-working leaders to take over under an up and out
system.  I am betting that we would continue to do better with the
current system that keeps the type of individuals named above around in
leadership roles as long as they are willing to actively serve, while
quickly making room on the Board (and other committees) for new
attorneys who show an interest in becoming leaders in the Center.   That
is the approach that has been followed in recent years, and it sure
looks to me to be the better approach for this organization than any of
the alternatives that have been discussed.

Gentlemen:

It is my understanding that Ann Ballard will be leaving Enron soon.  As a result of her departure, it is also my understanding that a new position may be created to handle federal compliance that would encompass matters related to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Federal Power Act.  If so, I would like to be considered for the position.  I have attached a copy of my resume below.

I hold a Doctor of Jurisprudence from the University of Houston.  While in law school I received an honors grade in Legal Research and Writing.  Additionally, I possess an excellent command of the English language.

I have approximately ten years of legal experience in the judicial, firm, and corporate environments.  My experience includes preparation of documents for all phases of litigation from pre-trial through the appellate level, administration and drafting of natural gas contracts, administration of all contracts related to the acquisition of water and wastewater facilities on a worldwide basis, and monitoring asset compliance requirements.  Currently, I act as a point of reference to various disciplines such as legal, tax, accounting, asset management, and restructuring.  I also utilize the Secretariat database in my day-to-day activities.  I possess extensive oral and written communication skills as a result of working in various legal environments.  I am comfortable working with employees across all levels of Enron.  

During my tenure at Enron I have worked on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Annual Report of Interlocking Positions filing.  This report is mandatory under Section 305(c)(1) of the Federal Power Act.  Further, while at Texaco, I prepared the Canadian National Energy Board's monthly report for the export of natural gas from Canada and the U.S. Department of Energy's quarterly sales and price report for the import of natural gas from Canada.

Please keep my inquiry regarding this position in confidence.

I look forward to hearing from you.

 
Sincerely,


Monique V. Shankle

Rob, I am very sorry Enron is experiencing difficulty. If you need help and  I can help in any useful way, I can suspend seminary studies and keep full  credit for what I have done by way of course studies since the end of 1999. It  seems we need to focus on having credible people get to the bottom of things  they were not involved in, and act urgently to sustain remaining confidence, and  in time restore confidence. I still have my law license, and I am not particular  about titles etc. I invested a lot of time and effort in the Company working all  across its markets and assets. I am in excellent health, and can keep my lip  zipped and report to you if you want me to. 
 
Not proud,

HIGHLIGHTS

BUSH SAID NOT LIKELY TO OFFER PLAN FOR GLOBAL WARMING AT
SUMMIT

President Bush is not likely to take a detailed plan for
combating global warming to next week's summit meeting in
Sweden with European Union leaders, although the president
is concerned about climate change, says his spokesman. With
a Cabinet-level group still studying the issue, Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer says the president is likely to
engage European leaders on broad issues related to climate
change and to hold off on offering specific recommendations.
Fleischer says the White House finds credible this week's
report by the National Research Council that outlines how
greenhouse gas emissions are still causing the Earth to
warm. In Luxembourg, the EU avoids an embarrassing split
when the outgoing Italian government supports ratifying the
Kyoto Protocol. . . . Page AA-1,  AA-2,  A-9

IBM ASKS TO USE SEMICONDUCTOR PLANT'S HAZARDOUS WASTE TO
MAKE CEMENT

EPA asks for comments on giving regulatory flexibility under
its Project XL to waste-handling operations at IBM's East
Fishkill semiconductor plant in Hopewell Junction, N.Y. The
principal objective of the project, EPA says, is to
determine whether the waste water treatment sludge resulting
from electroplating operations may be used as an ingredient
in cement without the regulatory controls of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act. . . . Page A-3

EPA WAIVES $350,000 IN FINES AFTER RIGHT-TO-KNOW VIOLATIONS
REPORTED

EPA waives nearly $350,000 in potential fines for seven
mid-Atlantic region companies after they voluntarily report
violations of the Emergency Planning and Community
Right-To-Know Act. The EPA Region III spokesperson tells BNA
all of the potential violations involved noncompliance with
reporting violations and not releases of toxins. Many of the
potential violations came to light as the companies hired
private consultants for self audits or to meet permitting
requirements. . . . Page A-10

EPA SEEKS VOLUNTARY EDUCATION PROGRAM ABOUT ARSENIC-TREATED
WOOD

EPA maintains its support for a voluntary industry program
to educate consumers about the safe handling of wood treated
with arsenic-based pesticides. At a public meeting, public
interest representatives and state health officials express
concern about arsenic leaching from the wood treated with
copper chromated arsenate. The EPA meeting includes a
presentation about the American Wood Preservers Institute's
efforts to teach consumers how to handle the wood. . . .

EXPOSURE LEVELS FOR PHENOL, PERCHLOROMETHYL MERCAPTAN CALLED
TOO STRICT

Some proposed Acute Exposure Guideline Levels for phenol,
another industrial chemical, and nerve agents are too
stringent, based on toxicological research of the compounds,

proposal for exposure levels for 13 chemicals and five nerve
agents. The National Advisory Committee for Acute Exposure
Guideline Levels is scheduled to discuss the proposed levels
next week. . . . Page A-6

SENATOR SEEKS TO BAN OIL, GAS DRILLING, BALLAST DISCHARGES
IN GREAT LAKES

New oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes would be banned
under legislation to be introduced next week by Sen.

LEARNING PROBLEMS FOUND IN ADULTS WHO EAT PCB-CONTAMINATED
FISH

Adults who eat fish contaminated with polychlorinated
biphenyls have problems learning and remembering new verbal
information, according to a study to be printed in the June
issue of "Enviornmental Health Perspectives". The
researchers say their study may be of interest to workers in
the electric circuit manufacturing industry because their
exposure to PCBs can be much higher than that incurred by
the fish-eaters. . . . Page A-10

NEW SOURCE REVIEW: The heads of EPA and the Justice
Department are invited to tour communities near petroleum
refineries while their agencies review enforcement actions
against oil companies and power plants. Dozens of
environmental groups write EPA Administrator Whitman and
Attorney General Ashcroft inviting them on "toxic tours" of
the communities with petroleum refineries. . . . Page A-4

CALIFORNIA DESERT: A portion of the California desert
designated as not in compliance with Clean Air Act standards
for particulate matter would be split into three separate
non-attainment areas under an EPA proposal. EPA's Region IX
says it will ask for public comments on its proposed
redesignation of the Searles Valley non-attainment area into
three areas: Coso Junction, Indian Wells Valley, and Trona.

Karen:

Attached are my suggested revisions to your 3:00 PM draft of the intercompany memo to be released by the Office of the Chairman early next week.
		
This collective draft now contains many of the suggestions that have been received by Steve Kean, Jim Derrick, John Sherriff and the GSS team and the questions/clarifications forwarded to me yesterday by Kevin Hannon yesterday.

Air travel has been clarified  to read, "Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or <http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron>, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts."  This will assure coverage outside the US and access to the Enron-negotiated fares with the carriers.

The car rental services section has been clarified to include insurance coverage availability.

The language regarding XMS has been modified to say "Effective July 1 or the effective date of the rollout in your location, all employees will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses."  Also, we are currently investigating future release dates for those locations where XMS is not yet available and plan to include such information in the FAQ's that will support this memo.

The URL/Web reference in the Professional Services section has been changed to http://ibuyit.enron.com/tibco.  This is the URL for iBuyit.  We are currently creating the content (FAQ's, procedures, forms, and etc.) that will be available via iBuyit to support the initiative.

The Offsite Meetings section has also been clarified to cover domestic-US events only. 

George

To:	The Enron Management Committee


The Enron Corp. Board of Directors approved a new Risk Management Policy (the "Policy") on August 14, 2001, and notice has been distributed to Enron employees to announce the posting of this policy on the Enron intranet website at http://home.enron.com/resources (without market risk limits due to confidentiality).  The Policy includes a three page Executive Summary providing an overview of risk management practices for the four major types of risks addressed: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk, and this summary is attached to this e-mail for your convenience.  The credit policy was incorporated without change, and the Transaction Approval Process and Guarantee Approval Processes were also incorporated with updating for specific approval authorities. 

This e-mail message is being sent to the Enron Management Committee to highlight some key aspects of the Company's market risk management practices which may be of interest.  

The Policy established a new Risk Management Committee, members of which are the Chief Risk Officer and any others designated by the CEO of Enron Corp.  During this transition period, existing Commodity Group Limits as of August 14th remain in effect, and Enron Business Unit Limits are assigned accordingly.  These limits may be further adjusted by the Risk Management Committee and the CEO, and your market risk managers will be working with you to review the limit structure for your business unit's activities to facilitate compliance with the Policy and your business initiatives.  RAC is currently working with Global Risk Management Operations to develop appropriate risk reporting that meets the Policy requirements and the needs of business unit management.

Summary of Changes to Market Risk Management Practices

In addition to consolidating Enron's various risk management policies and procedures into one comprehensive Policy, some substantive changes and clarifications were made to the Company's market risk management practices, as summarized below.  

1.	Increased the VaR Limit for the Trading Portfolio, providing discretion to the Enron Corp. CEO ("CEO") to allocate such VaR limits within defined parameters
2.	Established an Expected Tail Loss Advisory Limit for the Trading Portfolio
3.	Revised the Market Risk Limit Structure within each Portfolio to delegate more discretion for individual Business Unit and Commodity Group limits to the CEO and Risk Management Committee
a)   Concentration VaR Limits approved by Board of Directors 
b)   Business Unit VaR Limits approved by CEO / Risk Management Committee
c)   Commodity Group Limits for each Business Unit approved by CEO / Risk Management Committee
d)   Trader/Desk Limits approved by Business Unit Office of the Chairman


Key Points re: the Limit Structure
1.	Concentration Limits are established on 6 large buckets of commodity groups; this bucketing focuses on market indicators from a Board perspective, not according to Enron's organizational structure; 
?	1) Americas Gas, 2) Americas Power, 3) European Gas & Power, 
4) Products, 5) Financials, and 6) Emerging Businesses
o	Examples:  Americas Power Concentration Limit includes Global Risk Markets; Financials Concentration Limit includes Credit; Appendix A of the Policy lists the individual Commodity Groups comprising each Concentration Limit
2.	CEO/Risk Management Committee has discretion to allocate the Trading Portfolio VaR limit among the Enron Business Units, subject to the Concentration Limits approved by the Board
3.	Expected Tail Loss is a new risk metric, and accordingly, an advisory limit is established only at the total Trading Portfolio level; some Commodity Groups may have the measurement calculated in RisktRAC, but no limit is set
4.	Business Unit VaR Limits are to be set for each Enron Business Unit (i.e. Enron Americas, Enron Global Markets, Enron Europe, etc. - any Business Units recognized as having authority for trading by the CEO)
5.	Commodity Group Limits are now to be set at a Business Unit level, representing the individual Business Unit's authority for trading specific commodities
?	every Business Unit shall have a Commodity Group Limit for any commodities for which they are authorized to trade; 
?	these Commodity Group Limits and corresponding risk reporting will enable top management and the Risk Management Committee to quickly understand risk parameters on a "pure" commodity group basis within each Enron Business Unit;
6.	Each Enron Business Unit OOC can establish Trader/Desk Level Limits and/or related risk reporting as they require, enabling them to view their trading results the way they manage their business (i.e., the same trader may actually trade more than one commodity, and therefore wish to view risk parameters for several commodities combined, etc.)

Risk Management Benefits of Limit Structure: 1) CEO flexibility below the Concentration Limit level, and 2) individual Enron Business Units have clearly defined trading authority, enabling the Risk Management Committee to authorize business units to trade in the same commodities while strengthening risk management practices to facilitate compliance with the Board approved Concentration Limits 

Limit Monitoring and Reporting
1.	All position and VaR violations are triggered at 100% of the respective limit

Dad,
I really loved your response. I thought that it was extremly well written.
Fermenting grapes of wrath that was really well done. I appreciate you
putting up with my occasional lapses of judgment. MY time in Madrid is
rapidly shrinking away. Soon I will be boarding an airplane back to the good
ol USA and depending on my law school acceptance I will be coming to a fork
in my path. I will miss living in Madrid tremendously. It takes a while in
city such as this to feel at home and relaxed. I have been spending a lot of
time with a group of Spanish friends and have many good friends here that
because of geographic proximity will not see much of for some time. I had
this crazy dream last night that me and you had purchased a good size
sailboat and a huge box of hand carefully chosen novels and were setting off
on a sailing adventure around the world. That would be some adventure. I
have a book recommendation for you. A french writer by the name of Jean
Echenoz. The name of the book is Im Off. You might look for it if your in
the Book store. Once again I really enjoyed your response and keep me
update. Love, son

Ken and Jeff:

Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.

Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.

If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.

I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.

Thanks.

Jim Hughes

I'm fine with CC acting for third parties.  The principal CC contact for Wessex was Chris Bright, a regulatory lawyer (ex-Linklaters) who joined Shearman & Sterling a year ago.  If (and I mean if!) we sell Wessex, we'd want to use Chris for regulatory issues at least.

Dear Mark,

Do you have any news re our acting for a client in acquiring an equity stake
in Wessex Water? I am being chased by my partners about obtaining clearance
for them to act.

Please excuse me for in turn chasing you about this; I certainly appreciate
that you will have more important matters at your hands to deal with these
days, but for us accepting or refusing mandates from clients or would-be
clients time is of the essence; I am sure that you will understand this.

There are lots of employees wondering if/how they should react to all the class actions being filed, esp. those that are filed with employee plaintiffs and /or relate to benefit plans. It might be helpful to let people know how class actions work, that they don't need to sign up to be lead plaintiffs, that if awards or settlements occur they will have a chance to participate later, will be notified, etc. This might calm people down and avoid a stampede if rumors start flying around that if people don't sign up or join now they will be left out. 
  I look forward to seeing you at lunch. We can make it quick or even in office if your schedule is making lunch difficult. - - -DLH

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Based on the message below from Alf, I assume Heath-Lambert has been assisting you with this and agrees with your approach. If they agree, I think your approach in completing this is appropriate. Good work.

Good Afternoon
 
Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.
 
I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice. 
NOTE I would really like to complete this by Wednesday this week as this is my last week.

First version:  First paragraph probably falls under the requirements of SEC Regulation M-A (communications regarding the Enron/Dynegy merger).  This could be viewed as soliciting support for the merger ("?merger is in the best interests of shreholders.." etc.).  As such, it would have to include the Rule 425 legend and be filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 425 (unless you can argue that the reference to the merger is only in a non-substantive way---it doesn't read that way to me).  Also, the reference in that same first paragraph to "powerful competitor" may not sit well with the FTC with respect to the antitrust issues (probably not fatal, but we ought to think of another desciptive word).   

Second version:  Technically, I would say "secured" by, as opposed to "supported" by the assets of the pipelines when referring to the credit support for the facilities.  Second paragraph:  Same comments as the first paragraph in the first version addressed above.  Third paragraph:  I don't think it is a good idea to talk about "strong verbal indications" regarding the extension of maturities unless you are just about 100% confident that they will, in fact, be extended.  I think we are sending a message by such a statement that this maturity will be extended.  If there is a chance that it will not, I think this is a risky statement to make.  If it is made, perhaps we should include a forward looking statement factor to the effect "factors include Enron's ability to restructure scheduled maturities of debt"  (but my first choice would be not to include the quote).  I will try to be in early in the morning if you want to discuss.  Thanks, Rex

Subject:	Possible press release before market open on 11/20/01

Attached are two versions of a press release.  We plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow.  The second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility (I need someone to confirm or deny).  The first version speaks only to the merger and our debt restructuring efforts.  Please review and provide comments as soon as possible to me and Karen Denne (karen.denne@enron.com).  I understand that Jeff McMahon and Jimmy Lee will discuss the attached at 7:00 CST tomorrow.

Jim, these are the individuals at Hughes Hubbard I mentioned yesterday.
Kevin will be in Houston while he's wrapping up his time at American
General. I'd be pleased to introduce you to him. It was great to see you
yesterday. My thoughts are with you.....
