All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Regards,

Andy,
It was great to see you at the end of last week. The rest of the weekend flew by as George packed in 8 am golf games on Saturday and Sunday.Plus, visiting with guests, never gives one the time they need to relax or visit with friends. I hope you had a good rest.
I just wanted to send you a quick note to say hi and let you know that I am here if you need anything - and I am serious when i extend an open invitation to Connecticut. 
Keep in touch,
Always, Robyn

The SuperHotOffers.com Newsletter has moved!! 
In an effort to provide our subscribers with the best offers possible 
we have decided to move our newsletters to the best possible service we 
could find.  There were just too many times we would find ourselves 
receiving mail from our subscribers saying that they had not received 
their newsletter or were having difficulties unsubscribing.  As our 
subscribers are our most valued asset we had to think of you first.  
Our transfer has been a smooth one and we look forward to delivering 
the valuable offers and savings we always have, but this time without 
the hassle!
Now we realize that maybe you may not be interested in receiving our 
newsletter any longer.  If that is the case, simply click the below 
link and well make sure you are taken off of our list.  Its that easy!Please Remove Me 
While we hate to see you go, we also value your perception of us.  One 
of the reasons we have moved are the easy unsubscribe options available 
with this service.  Our desire is to have the cleanest email newsletter 
in the industry and if you no longer want to receive our newsletter we 
respect your choice.
Thank you for all of your support and we look forward to bringing you
only the best special offers and fantastic values we can in 2002!
Thank You,
Mark Osgood

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas

FYI,
 
    If your cellular phone bill was submitted for payment prior to December 17th, it was covered under pre-petition.  Meaning that the invoices were processed and placed in the system, but not paid.  Let me know if you have any questions.

"By following these recent option plays, YOU could have pocketed
sweet profits like...41% in 3 weeks with Microsoft calls...
150% in 2 months with Comex calls... And 160% in 5 weeks with
NASDAQ Internet Index calls... Or 60% on Swiss francs -- in only
6 weeks...

You could have done even better with these stock picks... 710%
in 8 months on Ballard Power, 175% in four months with Ashton
Mining. In the coming months, you'll have a chance to make even
more. Much more..."


Dear Daily Reckoning Reader,

Bluntly speaking... in the next two years more people are going
to get killed in the market than are going to make a killing.

If you've spent any time in the market, you know it has changed
dramatically since 1998... and right now it's super volatile.
The U.S. economy is vulnerable. Many investors are frightened.
They are retreating to T-bills, CDs and cash.

Frankly, for many investors... that's not a bad move.

They'll do better than the folks who stick with the index funds
and the typical mutual funds. But for those who understand what
the market is doing... where the smart money is going... what
sectors will remain strong no matter what the economy does...
have long-standing, heavy-hitting industry contacts...  and have
experience at making profits in a bear market... the next couple
of years could be the most profitable ever.

I'm writing to you today to help you join a small group of
investors who recently took advantage of a serious bottleneck in
the oil services sector to position themselves for a 90% profit
in just 15 days!  And they expect to make even more...

Another strategy they used grabbed 710% profits in seven months
on a power company... 100% in three months on a burgeoning
mining company... 376% in six months on an oil & gas pick...
175% in four months on a diamond company... and more...

You see, long before the bear started mauling the NASDAQ... it
tore up mining, oil and other real assets. Resource stocks got
killed. But that's over now. The bear has moved out.  And now
that we're seeing instability in the U.S. economy, massive
layoffs and diminishing confidence in the dollar, hard assets
are making an impressive rebound. A cursory look at the
headlines of your local paper tells the story.

Fact is, we're sitting on the cusp of a major long-term bull
move in resources and assets... with no end in sight.
Fortunately, because of the damage over the last few years --
these stocks are still at bargain prices! Experienced investors,
who get the market right and pick the winning companies, can
make more money faster in this sector than any other. All while
the average portfolio gets gutted like a house on the tail end
of a four-alarm blaze.

Last year, a well-known mining company was selling for over $17.
That company owns 50% of a rich property -- a deposit that
contains almost 20 million ounces of gold and 5 billion pounds
of copper. But right now, nobody cares. The stock is selling for
about two bucks. But get this, it has more than $2.50 of cash a
share in the bank... and that's on top of the mineral assets.

People were willing to pay $17 a year ago for a company that
didn't have the assets it now has for $2.10. Most investors
still are more interested in tech stocks with no assets.
Amazing, isn't it?  If you buy this company now -- while this
sector is on the way back up -- you get it at a discount to the
cash on hand... and they practically throw the mine in for
free.

The way I see it, you can't go wrong. If somebody wants to give
me a gold mine, I'll take it. And obviously I think that you
should too... But almost nobody is paying much attention to this
gold mine giveaway.

As usual, the Wall Street analysts ignore these tiny undervalued
gems... until they really take off.  But what do we care? We get
there first... while no one is watching. And pick up the
profits.

With mining shares now at mere fractions of their highs -- and
at even smaller fractions of what most analysts would consider
fair value -- you have a chance to reap huge returns. But -- and
this part is crucial
-- you have to get in right away... because the bull market in
natural resources is taking off now. We're seeing a long-term
bull market for natural resources ahead. Some of these stocks
will easily go up 30%... 70%... even 300% in a few weeks --
sometimes in a few days.

Extraordinary Buying Opportunities

While you may recognize me and my advisory service, Outstanding
Investments, from comments Bill Bonner has made in The Daily
Reckoning, I'm writing to tell you about an entirely different
and unique companion service I've developed... one that could be
especially valuable to you in the volatile months ahead  -- it's
called the Resource Trader Alert.

The Resource Trader Alert is an exceptional e-mail and fax
service specifically designed for investors who want to take
advantage of fast-moving opportunities... and more speculative
investments. And because they move fast and are a little
riskier... they are potentially much more profitable. Let me
give you an example.

In the early 1990s, Canada's Northwest Territories experienced a
tremendous rush of diamond explorers. Many of them were hoping
to cash in on a few "area plays" on the heels of an earlier
major discovery in the region. Predictably a few years later,
most of the excesses were gone. This left Resource Trader Alert
subscribers with an opportunity to buy up Ashton Mining at
bargain prices.

It began when we sent a team out to complete a technical review
of Ashton's initial exploration and discovery results in
northern Alberta. We liked what we saw. Though the company still
had a lot of drilling to do -- and a little more to prove before
we considered mentioning the stock in Outstanding Investments --
we felt comfortable enough to recommend Ashton as a speculative
buy to Resource Trader Alert subscribers at $4 a share.

Four months later, Ashton's share price topped out at over $11 a
share -- an increase of 175%!  But the key was getting in at a
good price. Taking a position in a stock at its earliest, most
speculative stage can only be accomplished with a service like
Resource Trader Alert.

Some Have Called Me A "Teen Stock Geek"...

Not that I mind. This volatile market has thrown many investors
for a loop. Even the pros. Mutual funds have hit the toilet...
but of course many of them are run by "27-year-old geniuses."
These guys can't even see a bear when it bites them... and
believe me, they've been bitten.

I like to think I'm of a different breed of analyst altogether.
I was investing in the market when most kids were collecting
45's or baseball cards.  My father, C.V. Myers, was one of the
original "gold bugs" -- he taught me the difficult lessons of
investing -- the ones most investors never learn -- before I
even learned to drive.

On one score, I bought gold bullion at $35 an ounce. That was
back in 1971. By the time it hit $100 in 1972, I was dying to
sell. I had already tripled my investment. But dad said, "No."
It was a fundamental rule... you don't sell if the fundamentals
that made you money are still intact.

By the time I'd made five times my investment... the profits
were practically burning a hole in my pocket. I wanted to sell.
My $10,000 had become $50,000... a fortune at the time.
Especially for an eager young buck like me. But ol' C.V. said to
hold on... "You never know the ultimate top of a stock until
it's past. And that means you have to sell below that peak when
the investment begins to fall.  The loss from the summit is
often a pittance compared to the gains earned during a long
ascent."

Still, I was dying to sell at $300... $400... $500... in fact
all the way up. And by 1979, gold peaked at over $800. But
honestly, there was no way to tell whether this was the top or
not.

Like today, the U.S. economy was in a quagmire. Fed chief Paul
Volker decided it was time to shore up the weak dollar. Gold
slipped and failed to make a new high. By the time it hit $650,
my dad issued an all-out sell signal and cashed in. I used the
tidy fortune to buy a house with my fianc?e, Angie. And learned
a powerful lesson about investing: It's even more important to
know when to sell than it is when to buy.

Experience Pays Off...

In a market where most fund managers tend to be under 30 and
have never seen a bear market or recession before, I bring to
the table over 20 years of experience.  This is a definite plus
to investors who seek to turn their hard-earned dollars into
moneymaking opportunities... fast.

What's more, living across the border in Canada gives me a
unique "insider's" insight into the U.S. market and allows me to
keep close contacts with the companies in the natural resource
sector that is so dominant in Canada... the second benefit I
bring to readers of The Daily Reckoning... and subscribers of
the Resource Trader Alert.

In the 2001 market, I see impressive opportunities in small and
micro cap stocks -- some call them penny shares -- and also in
stock options. Both offer the aggressive investor a shot at
making big returns -- QUICKLY.

You Could Have Made $9,000 In Two Weeks

When news breaks it can make you money fast... if you know how
to play it. On Nov. 15, 2000, I issued an alert with news of the
United Nations agreeing to pay Iraq for oil in euros instead of
dollars. That, coupled with the presidential stalemate, signaled
an "end to the greenback's hegemony over energy."  I smelled an
opportunity to cash in on the "weakness in the dollar."

I offered Resource Trader Alert readers a way to harness this
trend for quick gains. I won't go into all the details here...
but simply put, readers jumped on an easy way to do a "bull call
option spread" with the dollar against the Swiss franc.

Don't worry if you're not an expert on options.  While this may
sound like a complicated speculation that only huge investment
houses and central bankers make, it couldn't be more
straightforward.  I've reduced it to a simple call to your
broker. But for now, all you need to know is that this picks
limited our subscribers' risk and offered possible returns of up
to 400%.  In fact, following my strategy you could have started
with as little as $750 at risk.

On Dec. 28 - just six weeks later - the jig was up. I issued a
sell alert. That day you could have closed out your option and
made $450 a pop. Ten options would have netted you $4,500 profit
-- a cool profit of 60% in just six weeks!

All you had to do was read your alert... and call your broker.
It's that simple. Of course, not everything I recommend in
Resource Trader Alert does this well.... with markets as complex
and volatile as they are today, that would be virtually
impossible. But when you subscribe to the Resource Trader Alert,
you'll get the straight skinny and opportunities you would never
hear directly from your broker.

This May NOT Be For Everyone

Of course, in order to collect the big profits, you must assume
some risk. It goes with the territory... and is simply the
nature of investing in small, speculative companies or options.
But to counter this risk I use several strategies -- and intend
to increase your profits.

For one thing, Resource Trader Alert subscribers are always
encouraged to take their original capital off the table on a
double, and let the profits ride for even higher returns. Those
gains are risk-free. I call it the "Point of No Concern"
risk-management tool. Sell half on a double and recoup your
capital costs. And that's exactly what my subscribers have done
time and time again on stocks like Ultra Petroleum, El Misti
Gold, Western Copper, Francisco Gold and many others, including
Minefinders Corp.

When I first recommended Minefinders, the company's stock was
selling for about $2.50 per share. A little under four months
later, Resource Trader Alert subscribers received a bulletin
informing them that the share price had reached $5.60.  It more
than doubled!  And following the "Point of No Concern"
risk-management system, our subscribers were told to take their
initial investment off the table.  For example, if you had
invested $10,000, you'd now have over $20,000. With my
risk-management system, you would have recouped your initial
$10,000, but now have another $10,000-plus to invest again.

With each Resource Trader Alert you get a detailed explanation
of the investment opportunity. You'll see precisely why a stock
or option is being recommended... precisely how much to pay for
it... and what special action -- if any -- is necessary.

Plus, you'll be posted on any changes. You'll always have
specific instructions on exactly when to take profits. Sometimes
you're going to be in and out in a week or even a couple of
days, aiming for a quick killing of 50% or 100% profits. Other
times there's a longer-term perspective. But regardless of how
long we hold a stock, the alert service will keep you posted at
all times so you're in and out of a stock at the most profitable
prices.

Is this service for you? I don't know...

The Resource Trader Alert is a service for more aggressive
investors interested in taking advantage of the current bull
market in natural resources and hard assets with higher-risk and
faster-paced opportunities.

Some investors aren't interested in paying strict attention to
their investments at this fast level of timing. That's fine. The
Resource Trader Alert is a premium service designed for
subscribers with a financial ability to invest in earlier stage
speculations. Smaller investors probably shouldn't be involved
in this kind of trading. It's definitely not the place to invest
your rent money or retirement funds.

Still, if you want to consider more speculative investments --
those subject to greater risk -- they also offer the promise of
greater rewards -- such profits as 150% on Comex calls and 710%
on Ballard Power.

Once We Reach Full Capacity -- The Door Will Close.

When we say this service is for a select group of investors, we
mean it. I'm speaking here on behalf of my publisher, too. We
have a firm policy of limiting the number of subscriptions we
accept -- to protect you. We don't want to prematurely cause a
price hike on any of the thinly-traded stocks we write about as
more and more subscribers get in. and we don't want it to fall
as we're selling.

By our calculations, allowing only 500 subscribers to join is as
close to perfect as we can get. Just enough to open the circle
up to our more speculative readers -- yet limited enough to
protect your investment interests. We expect our remaining
available invitations to Resource Trader Alert to disappear 
quickly. If you're seriously interested in making fast profits
as safely as possible, please secure your spot today.

Otherwise, we'll have to return your money and put you on the
waiting list. It could be some time before a spot comes open
again for you. And I'm sure you don't want to miss out on the
profits.   In fact, I am getting ready to issue my next
recommendation, and I want you to have every possible chance to
take advantage of it.

And you can. In fact, for only $995 per year, you can benefit
from the Resource Trader Alert. That's about $20 a week -- just
about what it might cost you for a nice dinner on the town.  And
for that low price, you get a world-class trading advisory
service with the chance to make 150%, 276%... even 710% returns
on your money.  Enough to pay for this service many times over.

You'll receive alerts when it's time to buy, sell or simply when
something happens that warrants an update. With your
subscription, you are entitled to 48 alerts -- generally sent to
you every week via e-mail or fax... your choice.

What's more, with your subscription, you'll receive a free guide
to investing safely and profitably in small and micro cap and
option plays.  In this special report, "Raking in Huge Profits
on Penny Stocks and Options", you'll learn the basics, including
the art of buying and selling at the right time -- and
commonly-used terms in the investment world, so you're
well-educated when executing your investments.

Remember, with the incredible investment opportunities you'll
read about in the Resource Trader Alert, you could turn $10,000
into $27,500, as some of our subscribers had the chance to do
with Ashton Mining... or in the case of Minefinders, $15,000
into $33,600.  So... simply click here:

http://www.dailyreckoning.com/Volcanic.cfm

and order online today! (Remember to tell us how you want to
receive your alerts -- e-mail or fax.) Remember, that 10-to-1
shot isn't unusual in this business. Even 100-to-1 shots do
happen. I'm talking about $100,000... even $1 million paydays.
At any day, at any moment, the next profit opportunity may come
our way... don't miss it.

Sincerely,

John Myers,
Editor, Resource Trader Alert

P.S. Profitable opportunities often arise at a moment's notice.
And when they do, as a subscriber to Resource Trader Alert,
you'll be able to take full advantage of them and realize
outstanding gains -- like the 175% we made on Ashton Mining and
710% on Ballard Power. If you want these kinds of gains, then I
urge you to sign up now to this extremely lucrative service.

P.P.S. Options and small and micro cap stocks -- or penny stocks
-- may offer investors greater profits, but they can also mean
higher risks. Your free special report, "Raking in Huge Profits
on Penny Stocks and Options" will introduce you to how you can
rake in the profits, with limited risk, from these picks in
natural resources and real assets. "Raking in Huge Profits..."
is yours free when you accept this limited-time offer. Simply
click here: http://www.dailyreckoning.com/Volcanic.cfm  and
order online today! (Don't forget to tell us whether you want to
receive your alerts by e-mail or by fax.)

The paradox of our time in history  is that we have taller buildings but 
shorter tempers, wider freeways, but  narrower viewpoints.  We spend more, 
but have less.  We buy more,  but enjoy less.  We have bigger houses and 
smaller families, more  conveniences, but less time.  We have more degrees 
but less sense, more  knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more 
problems, more  medicine, but less wellness. 
We drink too much, smoke too much, spend  too recklessly, laugh too little, 
drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too  late, get up too tired, read 
too little, watch TV too much, and pray too  seldom.  We have multiplied our 
possessions, but reduced our values.   We talk too much, love too seldom, 
and hate too often.  We've  learned how to make a living, but not a life. 
We've added years to life not  life to years. 
We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have  trouble crossing the 
street to meet a new neighbor.  We conquered outer  space but not inner 
space.  We've done larger things, but not better  things.   
We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul.   We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice.  We write more, but  learn less.  We plan more, but accomplish less.  We've learned to  rush, but not to wait.  We build more computers to hold more information,  to produce more copies than ever, but we 
communicate less and less.  
These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small  
character, steep profits and shallow relationships.  These are the days  of 
two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes.   These are 
days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality,  one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to  quiet, to kill. 
It is a time when there is much in the showroom window  
and nothing in the stockroom.  A time when technology can bring this  letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or  to 
just hit delete. 
Remember, spend some time with your loved ones,  because they are not going 
to be around forever.  Remember, say a kind  word to someone who looks up 
to you in awe, because that little person soon  will grow up and leave your 
side. 
Remember, to give a warm hug to  the one next to you, because that 
is the only treasure you can give with  your heart and it doesn't cost a cent. 
Remember, to say, "I love you" to  your partner and your loved ones, but 
most of all mean it.  A kiss and  an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from 
deep inside of you.  
Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for 
some day that  person will not be there again.  Give time to love, give time 
to speak  and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.

June 7, 2001 - Intel rose after hours Thursday after announcing it will
meet estimates this quarter. Nasdaq futures traded up 2%, on top of a 2%
gain during the day.

The ISDEX http://www.wsrn.com/apps/ISDEX/ added 3 to 269, and the Nasdaq
surged 46 to 2264. The S&P 500 rose 6 to 1276, and the Dow added 20 to
11,090. Volume edged higher to 1.27 billion shares on the NYSE, but
declined to 1.62 billion on the Nasdaq. Advancers led 15 to 14 on the
NYSE, and 20 to 16 on the Nasdaq. For earnings reports, visit our earnings

hours quotes and news, visit our after hours trading site at
http://www.afterhourstrading.com.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) rose more than a point after hours after saying
revenues will be "slightly below the midpoint" of the range it provided on
April 17. But Handspring (NASDAQ:HAND) fell on an earnings warning.

During the day, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose 1.32 to 73.68, breaking out
of a 10-month base.

Chip stocks surged 7.7% after National Semi (NYSE:NSM), up 3.07 to 31.04,
beat estimates with a breakeven quarter and said the worst may be behind
the industry. Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM), up 5.14 to 40.71, warned but said it
is seeing an improvement in orders that could lead to a rebound later this
year.

S1 (NASDAQ:SONE), the best-performing Net stock last month, soared 2.35 to
13.85 on an alliance with IBM (NYSE:IBM).

Loudeye (NASDAQ:LOUD) soared .58 to 1.79 on a deal with Napster.

Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) rebounded 3.31 to 52.50 on comments from First
Union that the sell-off in the stock was overdone.

Salomon Smith Barney handicapped the winners and losers from the SuperComm
conference. The firm was cautious on Redback (NASDAQ:RBAK), Juniper
(NASDAQ:JNPR) and Nortel (NYSE:NT), and positive on Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO),
Extreme (NASDAQ:EXTR) and Foundry (NASDAQ:FDRY).

Some technical comments on the market: Note: We include charts in the
technical market commentary. If you can't get the charts via the e-mail
newsletter version, try this link:
http://www.afterhourstrading.com/column.html

The Nasdaq broke through 2252 resistance today and is clearly headed
higher tomorrow. Tonight we're going to take a look at the bigger picture
since the April lows and see what's forming, because at least for now, the
chart patterns forming off the lows look mainly bearish. The Nasdaq (first
chart) and Nasdaq 100 (second chart) could be forming either bearish
rising wedges (the black lines), or head and shoulders tops (the blue
lines). Our best guess is that they're rising wedges, and that those upper
trendlines will be reached in the near-term, but that's just a guess based
on the surprising strength in the market. However, at least one cycle
watcher is expecting a significant peak in the June 18-June 26 timeframe.
Those patterns make 2100-2150 on the Nasdaq and 1760-1850 on the Nasdaq
100 important support. A look at two possible outcomes: the Nasdaq 100's
bearish rising wedge rally of last summer (third chart), and the Dow's
bullish negation of a rising wedge at 10,300 in mid-April and subsequent
nicely-formed uptrend (fourth chart). We'll watch the charts for clues as
to how these patterns will resolve. Also notice that the S&P 500 (fifth
chart) and S&P 100 (sixth chart) could be forming head and shoulders tops
within otherwise nicely shaped uptrends. Note that the Dow and S&P 100
bounced off their uptrend lines today.

COMMENT ON FED RATE CUT
Dr. Ed Yardeni
Chief Investment Strategist
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown
April 19, 2001

Now there are 450 basis points left between the federal funds rate and zero.
Since the start of the year--in less than four months--the Fed folks have
reduced the rate by 200 basis points, while the jobless rate has remained
close to 4%. The message to equity investors is clear: The folks at the Fed
don't want a recession, and they do want consumers to keep shopping.
According to the official easing statement yesterday, they acted in response
to a recent set of developments that "threatens to keep the pace of economic
activity unacceptably weak."

This wording suggests that they must be aiming for economic growth that is
acceptably strong. Apparently, they now understand that the profits
recession was on the verge of turning into an economy-wide recession. Nearly
every company reporting disappointing profits in recent weeks also announced
plans to cut employment. Obviously, if many companies do so, consumer
spending would be depressed and profits would continue to fall during the
second half of the year.

Interestingly, the Fed folks strongly implied in their statement that they
now want stock prices to rise to offset "the possible [negative] effects of
earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption." This is a dramatic
reversal from early last year, when the Fed Chairman said that the stock
market rally was causing a wealth effect that was stimulating excess demand.

Our Chief Economist, Peter Hooper, has accurately anticipated that the Fed
would respond to a weakening economy by lowering interest rates. He expects
that another half-point cut is coming at the May 15 meeting of the policy
committee. I have shared this outlook. (You might recall that at the end of
last year, I suggested you should chant the following mantra to calm any
recession anxiety: "There are still 650 basis points between the fed funds
rate and zero.")

So how does the Fed's latest action change the outlook for the stock market?
Most importantly, it reduces the likelihood that consensus earnings
expectations will continue to decline over the remainder of the year. Even
if there are some more negative surprises for the first and second quarters,
most analysts are likely to remain optimistic about the second half of the
year and 2002, especially now that the Fed has sent such a clear pro-growth
message.

On the other hand, earnings valuation multiples are unlikely to rise from
currently high levels if the 10-year government bond yield remains around 5%
through the end of the year as no seems more likely than another drop.
Furthermore, stocks are now 11% overvalued as a result of the dramatic rally
in stock prices in recent days combined with the backup in yields. The bulls
can rightly cheer, "The Fed is our friend!" However, stocks aren't cheap,
though many are certainly cheaper than a year ago.

The Fed is clearly the consumers' friend. So I reiterate my preference for
consumer cyclicals, especially retailers. However, if retailers continue to
advance, we may have to lighten up at some point if valuations become overly
rich. I think entertainment, recreation, and media stocks should also
benefit from easier credit conditions.

Consumer finance stocks should remain strong since the risk of
recession-induced loan delinquencies is reduced. Money center and regional
banks are also winners now that the yield curve is no longer inverted,
thanks to the Fed. In addition, the quality of their loan portfolios is
likely to remain sound. Investment bankers and asset managers should be more
profitable in this improved outlook for the financial markets during the
second half of the year. Nevertheless, I am neutral on the bond-sensitive
industries (Life Insurance, P&Cs, and S&Ls) which will probably mark time
for the rest of the year.

I may have overstayed my underweight position in technology given the
impressive rebound over the past week. Fortunately, I continue to recommend
1) an overweight in software (no inventory or commoditization issues) and,
2) a market weight in semiconductors (high profit margins when sales
rebound). More generally, Tech remains an earnings-challenged sector, but
investors seem to mostly believe that "it's so bad, it can't get any worse."
They are probably right, but it may not get much better either for a while.
There are still plenty of dot-coms that haven't crashed and burned yet, but
are burning cash fast. Cisco can write-off inventories, but they still need
to be sold. On the other hand, I do expect a wave of M&A activity in the
Tech and Telecom sectors. Such consolidation could help to solve some of the
excess capacity and competitive issues hurting many tech industries'
profitability. For this reason, I am raising my Computer Hardware
recommendation to market weight. I remain fond of wireless infrastructure
equipment for running businesses on a truly real-time basis.

My "Power Play" stocks (Energy & Utilities) did not participate in
yesterdays rally. But I think once the Tech euphoria cools off and the
summer heat drives up gasoline and electricity rates, they will do well. In
about a month, the Bush Administration will release its energy plan, which
should raise awareness of how much we must invest in power production and
distribution after so many years of neglect.

Health Care also was left behind yesterday. Maybe it is too defensive for
yesterday's growth chasers. However, I think that a Biotech-led advance for
this sector is likely over the remainder of the year. The more established
Biotech companies are actually reporting some very respectable earnings
performances.

Finally, let me mention that Basic Materials, a tiny sector in the S&P 500,
is rapidly consolidating, most recently in the metals & mining, paper, and
steel industries. I like the stocks. I also like Defense & Aerospace. I'm
neutral on Consumer Staples and Transportation.

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Andrew,

UK's Blair to open second term with Cabinet reshuffle.

The STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS

The NASDAQ and S&P 500 were higher overnight as they extend
Thursday's gains. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that
the rebound off last week's low is likely to continue into mid-June.
Closes above May's highs would renew this spring's rallies. Until
then one should view present rallies as corrective bounces.
Meanwhile, the Dow posted an upside reversal on Thursday following
Wednesday's corrective break. Momentum indicators are bullish
signaling that additional gains during June are possible.

European markets were higher in overnight trading despite a decline
in Germany's decline in industrial production and the continued fall
in sterling. Modest support due to gains on Wall Street led by chip-
related stocks along with a reassuring report from Intel Corp helped
underpin European stock markets overnight. The UK FTSE-100 was up
18.90 points at 5967.20 while the German DAX-30 was up 70.70 points
at 6254.95 as of 11:00 BST.

The Nikkei closed higher overnight as high-technology stocks
benefited from the Nasdaq's rally overnight and Intel Corp.'s
positive performance update. Overnight gains confirmed Thursday's
upside reversal as the Nikkei extended this week's rebound following
a test of the 50% retracement level crossing at 12,995. Friday's
gains have turned a number of oversold momentum indicators neutral to
bullish signaling that a short-term bottom has likely been posted.
The Nikkei closed up 152 points to 13,430.

INTEREST RATES

September bonds were slightly lower overnight due to spillover
selling following Thursday's round of profit taking, which led to a
key reversal down. Additional weakness during the day session would
confirm Thursday's bearish reversal pattern thereby increasing the
odds that a short-term top has likely been posted. Momentum
indicators are bullish but poised to turn bearish with additional
weakness.

The German bond market or Bunds were lower overnight. Dealers and
technical traders will be watching to see if the lower prices
realized over the past two sessions are enough to draw real money
investors into the markets. The risk in the market is still focused
on the euro and there is enough uncertainty there to keep investors
on the sidelines. The Sept. Bunds were last down 0.03 at 106.48.

Japanese government bonds closed lower overnight as traders closed
out their long positions ahead of the current lead June futures last
trading day on Monday. Firmness in the Nikkei weighed on JGB futures.

The ENERGY MARKETS were mostly higher in overnight trading due to
short covering triggered by refinery snags caused by stormy weather
in the U.S. Gulf. Additional support came from news that Exxon's
Baytown, Texas 110,000 bpd catcracker shut down on Wednesday for
repairs.

July crude oil was higher overnight in narrow trading as it continues
to consolidate above this year's uptrend line, which crosses near
27.10. Momentum indicators are bearish but oversold warning traders
to use caution as a short-term bottom might be near. Closes above
Monday's high crossing at 28.74 would temper the near-term bearish
outlook in July crude.

July heating oil was higher overnight as it is working on a potential
inside day. July's inability to close below Wednesday's low, which
now appears to have marked a double bottom sets the stage for a
possible short covering bounce in the near future. Closes below
Wednesday's low would set the stage for a test of May's reaction low
crossing at 74.55. Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming
oversold warning bears that a corrective bounce is possible.

July unleaded gas was higher overnight due to light short covering as
it continues to consolidate below broken trendline support. Momentum
indicators are bearish but oversold hinging that a pause or
corrective bounce is possible near-term. If the decline resumes,
April's reaction low crossing at 85.40 is July's next target.

July Henry Hub natural gas was lower overnight in narrow trading as
it continues to consolidate above last week's low. Closes below this
support level would renew this year's decline while opening the door
for a possible test of the 62% retracement level of the 1999/2001
rally crossing at 3.64 later this month. Momentum indicators are
turning bearish once again signaling that additional weakness is
possible.

CURRENCIES

The September Euro is working on a possible inside day but was
slightly lower overnight as it continues to extend this week's narrow
trading range. Closes below 84.16 would renew this spring's decline.
Momentum indicators are neutral to bearish thereby leaving the door
open for additional weakness. It would take closes above this week's
high crossing at 85.85 to temper the near-term bearish outlook in the
euro.

The September British Pound plunged to a new 15-year low overnight
following the Labour Party's victory this week. This week's breakout
below long-term chart support crossing at 139.52 has opened the door
for a test of the February 1986 low at 136 later this spring.
Momentum indicators are bearish signaling sideways to lower prices
are possible near-term.

The September Swiss Franc was lower overnight as it extends its
decline following Wednesday's key reversal down. Closes into new lows
would set the stage for a possible test of weekly chart support
crossing at .5508 later this year. The ADX (a trend-following
indicator) remains in a bearish mode signaling that additional
weakness is still possible.

The September Canadian Dollar was higher overnight as it is
challenging the 62% retracement level of this year's decline crossing
at .6573. Multiple closes above this resistance level would confirm a
breakout thereby opening the door for a possible test of February's
gap, which begins at .6600. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling
that sideways to higher prices during the first half of June are
possible.

The September Japanese Yen turned lower overnight thereby ending
Thursday's corrective bounce. With a short-term top now in place, the
door is open for sideways to lower prices into mid-June as the
September yen is resuming this spring's trading range. Stochastics
and RSI have turned bearish signaling that additional weakness is
likely.

PRECIOUS METALS

August comex gold was higher in overnight trading as it continues to
extend the narrow trading range, which has formed around the 75%
retracement level of the decline off May's high crossing at 267.20.
Closes above 269.60 are needed to temper the near-term bearish
outlook in August gold. If the decline resumes, the reaction low
crossing at 263.20 is August's next target. Stochastics and RSI are
bearish but oversold warning bears not to press their hand as a low
may be near.

July silver was slightly higher in narrow trading overnight as it
consolidates above trading range support crossing at 4.31. Closes
below this support level crossing at 4.31 would open the door for a
possible test of weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month.
Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness
near-term is possible.

July copper plunged to new contract lows overnight thereby renewing
its decline off May's high and is challenging weekly support crossing
at 74.10. Closes below this support level could lead to a test of
weekly support crossing at 72.70 later this month. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are
still possible.

GRAINS

July corn was lower overnight due to light profit taking following
Thursday's low-range close. Uncertainties over extended weather
forecast and ideas that it's too early to push the panic button
despite declining crop conditions weighed on corn prices late
Thursday and in the overnight trade. I would not be surprised to see
additional profit taking during the day session, as traders are
unlikely to press the long side of the market ahead of the weekend.
Next Monday's crop conditions report will likely show another decline
in ratings due to this week's cool/wet weather across the Midwest. It
would take closes above Thursday's high at 2.01 1/2 to set the stage
for a test of May's high crossing at 2.11 1/2 later this month. Early
calls are for July corn to open a 1/2 to 1 cent lower this morning.

July wheat was fractionally higher in overnight trading due to
spillover support from Thursday's strong export sales and continued
hot/dry conditions across China. Additional support came from wet
conditions across portions of the Plains, which has slowed winter
wheat harvest. Wednesday's test of the contract low at 2.58 1/2 may
have also marked a double bottom. However, it will take closes above
last Friday's high at 2.72 before this is confirmed. Stochastics and
RSI are diverging and turning bullish hinting that a short-term
bottom may be in place. I am looking for an inside day as traders are
unlikely to take a major position ahead of the weekend. Early calls
are for July wheat to open steady to 3/4 of a cent higher this
morning.

SOYBEAN COMPEX

July soybeans were lower in overnight trading due to light profit
taking following Thursday's steady close. Uncertainties over the
extended weather forecasts for the Midwest leave the market
vulnerable to additional profit taking during the day session. The
cool/wet conditions that have dominated Midwest weather this week
should be reflected in next Monday's planting progress report. At the
same time, emergence concerns and slow crop development along with
continued strong demand should continue to underpin both old and
new-crop prices. Momentum indicators are bullish but nearing their
respective overbought zones warning bulls to use caution. Early calls
for July soybeans to open 2 to 2 3/4 cents lower this morning.

July soybean meal was also lower overnight due to light profit taking
following Thursday's spike above the 62% retracement level of this
winter's decline crossing at 169.40. Additional weakness during the
day session is needed to confirm Thursday's downside reversal, which
would then increase the odds that a short-term top might have been
posted. At the same time strong domestic and foreign demand along
with a tight cash market will continue to underpin the meal market
thereby limiting near-term downside risk. Early calls are for July
soybean meal to open a $1.00 to $1.10 lower this morning.

LIVESTOCK

August hogs closed modestly higher on Thursday due to improving
cutout values and spillover strength from bellies. Light fund and
cash connected buying also underpinned today's rally. Today also
marked the official start of the Goldman roll as they were selling
July and buying August. If the rally resumes, April's high crossing
at 65.95 is August's next target. Closes below last week's gap at
64.00 would strongly suggest that a short-term top has been posted.

August cattle extended this week's decline closing lower for the
fourth day in a row. However, a short covering bounce ahead of the
close tempered some of today's losses leading to a mid-range close. A
short covering bounce on Friday is possible as traders bank some of
this week's short profits. Momentum indicators have turned bearish
signaling sideways to lower prices into mid-June are possible.

FOOD & FIBER

July coffee closed lower on Thursday due to bearish short-term
weather forecasts for Brazil's coffee growing region. July remains
poised to test the late-May low crossing at 57.10. Closes below this
support level would renew this year's decline. However, momentum
indicators are oversold hinting that a short-term low is in place or
near. Closes above 60.80 are needed to temper the near-term bearish
outlook in the market.

July cocoa closed into new lows for the week thereby confirming the
recent breakout below this spring's trading range, which crosses at
955. Today's new low close for the month has renewed the decline off
May's high while setting the stage for a test of fib support crossing
at 862 later this month.

July sugar closed lower on Thursday thereby confirming yesterday's
key reversal down. Today's loss was enough to keep momentum
indicators bearish, as the stage is set for a possible test of last
week's low at 839. Closes below this support level would renew the
decline off May's high and open the door for a test of fib support
crossing at 832 then 808 later this month.

July cotton closed lower on Thursday as it continues to consolidate
above psychological support crossing at 40-cents. Closes above this
year's downtrend line crossing near 43.95 are needed to confirm a
bottom and trend change has taken place. Momentum indicators are
neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices near-term
are possible.

Photos, music, important documents?
Now that everything is on your computer, copy it
The EPO CD Backup Duplicator makes flawless copies of any format CD, including audio, data or video.

To make backup copies of CDs, you typically need a CD reader (CD-ROM) for the source disk you are copying, a CD burner (CD-R or CD-RW) to write the copy CD, and a computer with appropriate software to format the files. The EPO CD Backup Duplicator does it all-easily and automatically-without the need of a computer. Most duplicating procedures may not be able to copy certain protected files. But CD Backup uses a technology called "image copy" to duplicate the exact same data found on the original disk. The EPO CD Backup can flawlessly duplicate any format of compact disk, even protected ones (see warning below). The CD Backup is the right choice for excellent accuracy.
You can use CD Backup to copy important data and application files for safe storage. And you can use the duplicator to create your own personal audio disks from tracks taken from your own personal CD collection.*

CORRECTION: In the May 31 Media Grok, we reported that television ads
for Outpost.com were aired during the Super Bowl. That was not the
case. Also, we misattributed a quote by a PC Connection spokesman to
that company's CEO. We regret the errors.

Juno and NetZero: A Skeptic's Field Day

Unfortunately for Juno and NetZero, the press seemed to use news of
the free ISPs' planned merger as a refresher course in being
skeptical, with virtually all outlets expressing doubt about the
combined company's prospects for success. Witness TheStreet.com's
George Mannes: "Divided they'd fall. Now the question is whether
united they'll stand." And that's one of the nicer characterizations.

Reporters had no trouble rounding up analysts and other observers to
suggest that the deal, which would make United Online, as the new
company will be called, second only to America Online in subscribers,
won't ultimately have much effect on the companies' sagging fortunes.
Heck, even NetZero CEO Mark Goldston, who will head the new company,
said the free ISP idea isn't all it was once cracked up to be, telling
the San Jose Mercury News, "The free model absolutely works when you
put usage limits on it. Free doesn't work when you don't have the
capital and you can't wait out the advertising downturn."

The Wall Street Journal talked to Earthlink president Michael S.
McQuary, who didn't miss a chance to get a jab in at the competition:
"When you add more weight to a sinking ship, it just sinks faster."

A few outlets mentioned that the merger will put an end to the
quarreling that's been going on between Juno and NetZero for the last
year or so; others focused on the companies' furious struggles to
convert free users into paid. Under the new agreement, free service
will be offered under the NetZero name, while those lucrative paid
subscribers - currently only 1 million of the companies' 7 million
customers, as outlets were happy to point out - will belong to the
Juno brand name. (Griped one analyst to the L.A. Times, "They'll just
lose money cooperatively.")

Though the $70.7 million agreement between the companies was widely
described as a merger, that term, as usual, has a very flexible
definition. NetZero stockholders would own about 61.5 percent of the
company, and Juno president Charles Ardai would slip off to sunnier
climes while NetZero's Goldston takes over, once the deal is completed
later this year. As for United Online's prospects, the folks at
SatireWire weighed in, running a short piece with the headline "Juno,
NetZero Merger to Create Largest ISP to Someday Declare Bankruptcy."
How's that for skeptical? - Michaela Cavallaro

Microsoft Supplies the Missing Links

Microsoft celebrated the one-year anniversary of a federal judge's
order to break up the company by stirring a fresh firestorm of media
criticism over a new feature that enables its browser to add links to
other publishers' Web sites.

The feature, Smart Tags, shows up on the browser and on some Office
applications in test versions of Microsoft's Windows XP operating
system, set to be released on Oct. 25. When a page loads into
Microsoft's Internet Explorer, the browser can identify words in the
text and attach links to Microsoft's own sites, or sites Redmond is
friendly with.

News.com's Joe Wilcox reported the feature on Wednesday, describing it
primarily as a way to build links from applications such as
Microsoft's Excel spreadsheets to Microsoft's Web services. Ticker
symbols in a spreadsheet could link to company information on
Microsoft's MSN MoneyCentral site. Wilcox quoted analysts who wrung
their hands over the prospect of Microsoft hijacking visitors to its
own sites. "Wouldn't that be something," Gartner analyst Michael
Silver said. "You spend millions of dollars designing a Web site, and
Microsoft has a Smart Tag that sends (users) to one of (Microsoft's)
own sites." Grok wonders if Judge Jackson would find that to be
something.

On Thursday, Wall Street Journal columnist Walter Mossberg turned up
the heat, calling Smart Tags "something new and dangerous." A
Microsoft official had the gall to tell Mossberg the feature will
spare users from "underlinked" sites. Supposedly, the feature will
come turned off by default in new browsers, and Web site publishers
will be able to add a tag to their pages to block the feature. "If the
feature is so benign," Mossberg writes, "why is Microsoft hiding it
and offering sites a way to block it?"

By Thursday afternoon, the war drums were pounding. On Slashdot,
notice of the tags drew, predictably, several hundred damning comments
from Redmond-baiters, and hoots of chortling, cynical laughter at
Michael Silver's comment on News.com that "I don't think there's any
nefarious plot."

Nick Wingfield's report in Friday's Wall Street Journal quoted
UserLand Software chief executive (and sometimes Microsoft critic)
Dave Winer saying, "It's creepy. It's bad. ... They don't have the
right to modify my work." Microsoft appears to be already tugging
nervously at its collar; a spokesman reminded us that "things
sometimes change from the time they're in beta to the time they ship."
Looks like there's plenty of time to change the code, or at least
change the spin. - David Sims

Everything's Coming Up Semiconductors

Maybe it's the approach of the weekend or the nearness of summer, but
all it takes are a few words from Intel, and the bulls are on the
loose. In its first-ever mid-quarter conference call (thanks to those
pesky SEC regulations that make companies share their secrets with all
investors, not just selected analysts), Intel said things aren't
really as bad as they seem. As Bloomberg put it, "the largest
chipmaker said second-quarter sales will be at the lower end of its
estimates, surprising investors who had expected less."

In a conference call variously described as "positive," "upbeat" and
"relatively good," Intel execs expounded on the wonders of what they
said is a rebounding PC market. Analysts - and reporters, for that
matter - would love for that to be true; one analyst told Bloomberg,
"This is almost like a status quo announcement, and these days, that's
mildly positive." TheStreet.com mentioned, however, that the company
is "a bit of a lone voice in the personal computer sector right now,"
since other manufacturers are still saying the market is weak.

Andy Bryant, Intel CFO, did acknowledge that the communications-chip
part of Intel's business is still lousy and getting worse, though he
added that the second half of the year should be better as regular
seasonal ordering patterns pick up. Not so fast, cautioned the
Financial Times: "Last year the traditionally strong second half for
Intel did not materialize. Also, a large part of its revenues are
usually booked in the final few weeks of its quarter, which makes it
more difficult for the company to know at the mid-quarter if it will
meet its prior expectations."

Even National Semiconductor's news that it "expects a deep loss and a
further decline in sales in the current quarter," according the Wall
Street Journal, didn't dampen anyone's spirits. Nat Semi, as the
Journal chummily called it, did manage to beat its own lowered
earnings expectations, and the San Jose Mercury News reported that CEO
Brian Halla "offered a slight glimmer of hope for the downtrodden
communications sector." These days, it seems, that's enough to make a
bull out of the gloomiest investor. - Michaela Cavallaro

COMMENT: In 1984, I coined the term "Bond Vigilantes" to describe the
growing power of fixed income investors and traders over the economy. In
recent years, they've lost some of their clout because the U.S. Treasury is
paying off the federal debt. Also, inflation has been relatively tame, and
so have they. Venture capitalists became the new power elite in the late
1990s leading the Nasdaq to record highs. Now the bond crowd is back: They
are tightening credit conditions, while the Fed is easing. The Treasury bond
yield is up over 50 basis points since March, which is boosting mortgage
rates. The spread between A-rated corporate and 10-year Treasury yields has
widened dramatically from around 150 basis points at the end of 1999 to more
than 250 basis points recently. The high-yield and commercial paper markets
are essentially shutdown for all but prime borrowers.

On the other hand, the yield curve is ascending again with the 30-year yield
more than 200 basis points above the 3-month T-bill rate. At the start of
the year, the curve was inverted with a spread of 50 basis points. This is
good news because an ascending yield curve gives banks and other financial
intermediaries an incentive to lend. The banks also have lots of money to
lend because shell-shocked stock investors are putting more of their funds
into bank deposits, which are up $350 billion over the past 12 months.

The resulting rapid rise in the monetary aggregates is Exhibit A in the case
against both a recession and a prolonged bear market in stocks. Indeed, real
GDP was up 2% during the first quarter and stock prices have rebounded
nicely since early April. Still, the rolling recession is likely to continue
rolling over the technology industry, and shows more signs of spreading to
labor markets around the country. Furthermore, the stock market is now more
than 15% overvalued as stock prices rose at the same time that earnings
expectations fell and bond yields moved higher.

SUBSCRIBERS: I can only conclude that either bond investors need Prozac, or
stock investors are back on Ecstasy. For more on this subject, see my latest
GLOBAL PORTFOLIO STRATEGY and tune into my Monday WEEKLY AUDIO FORUM. In my
latest commentary, I also lower my outlook for 2001 S&P 500 operating
earnings per share from $53 to $50. The profits recession is getting worse.
In the latest EARNINGS WEEK, Joe Abbott and I observe that already 132
companies have publicly released downward guidance for the second quarter!
We also slice and dice the Energy sector, which remains one of our
"overweight" recommendations.

PUBLIC: Our ONLINE CHART ROOMS are packed with Slide Shows of credit and
yield curve spreads. Did you know that Xerox is the best performing
component of the S&P 100 so far this year, followed by Microsoft? We've
added more Daily Stock Trackers to help you keep track. Check out the
important results of April's CIO Magazine Tech Survey (in partnership with

HotToday: Futures - http://ctsTrader.com

______June the 8th, 2001__________
-------------------------------------------------------
CTS HOT TODAY: FUTURES
By Nick Van Nice
-------------------------------------------------------
_________Volume 3, Number 113___________

Good morning everyone, the purpose of CTS Hot Today: Futures
is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead.
--------------------------------------------------------
Nick's Trading Tip of the Day (06/08)
--------------------------------------------------------
"Develop your own favorite Indicators"

Every trader has his or her favorite indicators much like a bass
pro has favorite lures and color combinations. In my opinion, it
is very important to develop confidence and a mastery of a few good
indicators, before attempting to learn too many.

A powerful lesson I've learned is the importance of
keeping my trading method simple. When I keep things simple, it makes
it easier to understand my results. There's nothing better than to
completely understand your method to a point of mastery. Many positive
things,
including a deeper conviction in your trading will start to emerge.

I have complete confidence in this approach:

#1 - Utilize the CTS Futures Selector as a trend condition to select
the futures markets to trade. I trade all three categories.

#2 - Utilize daily and hourly stochastics for setting up the trade.
I look for trend confirmation signals as a primary set-up condition.

#3 - Elliott wave counts are utilized for timing entries and establishing
price targets. The wave counts are done by me personally and give me a road
map structure to follow for the 1-3 day period (hourly)1-3 week period
(daily).

Wow, talk about a dead cat bounce! Have you seen what Gold has done
lately. A break below support near 266 opens the door for a $10/oz
drop! Friday's COT report for commercials will be big! If they
have held onto large short position, then look out below! I can smell
small spec bottom feeding.

The seasonal of corn over wheat continues to work as Mr. Bernstein
outlined in High Odds Seasonals. Jake has offered many ctsTrader.com
subscribers some great seasonal reco's this year!

Check out the pattern in August Feeders! A breakout above today's
high will trigger a trend confirmation buy signal on hourly charts.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

As long term subscribers know, we have been more upbeat
than most in our economic outlook.  Now the recession
has disappeared and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
has exceeded the Nikkei.  What more could one ask for ?
We had always believed that prior to September 11th a
recession would have been avoided, but we were hoping that
the Dow would exceed the Nikkei at "somewhat" higher
levels.  All kidding aside, though, last week was positive.

To almost everyone's surprise, 4th Qtr GDP was positive,
but barely so.  So, for the record, at least until the
revisions are released, 2001 GDP growth by quarter was
+, +, -, +.  That doesn't officially qualify as a recession,
but there certainly was a profits recession, and that's
what counts.  Nonetheless, there is a message in the data.

Specifically, if such a mild "recession" can cause such a
severe erosion in corporate profits, the "flip-side"
should be that leverage works both ways.  In other words,
as the economy recovers, profits could surprise on the
upside, even as we believe overall economic growth will
disappoint by "snapping back" less than consensus.

Although the 4th qtr GDP number was driven by consumer
spending, the personal income data imply that the consumer
should not hunker down.  The gain was the best since December
of last year, and with auto companies already announcing
deals, the price sensitive shopping trends should continue.

The other noteworthy item in the GDP report was the huge
drop in inventories, and yet overall GDP was still positive.
With consumer spending likely to be maintained, it seems
highly likely that the inventory correction is over, and
that production will have to increase in the near future.
In fact, some of the lead reports already imply that is
the case - say the new orders component of the Chicago
Purchasing Managers' Index.

The Labor Department Report was also a positive surprise.
However, at year end there are a lot of cross currents in
the numbers so we wouldn't read too much into the decline
in the unemployment rate. Nonetheless, it could have some
psychological significance, and help maintain the more
upbeat tone of consumer confidence.

And finally, there is the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) and their decision to leave rates unchanged, but
to maintain their bias toward lower rates.  As you know,
we expected the former, but thought they would remove
the bias given the rise in consumer confidence and the
three consecutive monthly gains in the leading indicators
series.  It appears that they are trying to micro manage
expectations, as the bias is clearly not needed.

My point is simply that Chairman Greenspan appears to be
becoming increasingly sensitive to financial market
reactions to the FRB's actions of any kind.  He went out
of his way to "correct" the negative impression, we would
argue misinterpretation, of one of his speeches.  Our view
now is that he wanted to leave the bias in place to drive
home his view, and ours, that the recovery will not be sharp.
And, of course, at a subsequent meeting they can remove the
bias, to reinforce perceptions of recovery.  We think such
an approach is a tad too cute, but probably harmless.

Overall, we obviously continue to like the economic data.
It supports our view of a recovery by Spring, if one hasn't
already begun.  Under such a scenario, earnings estimates
should at least hold, taking pressure off the stock market.
We'll see, but at the moment we like the risk/reward ratio.

Andy,

We are in the process of finalizing the high level design for the Risk
Management Simulation and need your input on some details. Please focus on
the trader tasks; I have provided the structurer tasks FYI.  If you could
please provide your feedback by noon on Wednesday, it will help ensure that
the BRM Deal stays on schedule and on budget.

I have attached two documents:
1) Simulation Flow
   Depicts the flow of the learner's tasks through the simulation
   Provides context for the "Learner Tasks" document (see below)
   Please respond with any concerns or questions about the flow (For
   example,  tasks are out of order; two tasks are listed separately that
   should be combined, etc.)

2) Learner Tasks
   Provides a detailed description of each task the learner will complete
   Please answer the italicized questions in the document (the questions
   are written throughout the chart; a list of all the questions can be
   found at the end of the document)
   Please edit any points you would like to change (For example, a key
   learner decision is missing, we are giving the learner a piece of
   information that they should be calculating or gathering on their own,
   etc.)
   The easiest way to edit this document is to: 1) Detach the file from
   this e-mail and save it on your hard drive. 2) Open the document and
   track changes by selecting Tools/Track Changes/Highlight Changes; check
   all 3 check-boxes, and click OK. 3) Answer the questions and make any
   necessary edits 4) Attach the document to an e-mail and send it back to
   me

This is a critical week for our team; we need to finalize these details as
soon as possible in order to move on to detailed design. If you will be
unable to review these documents by Wednesday, please let me know when you
will be able to provide your input.

Thank you for your help. If you have any questions, you can reach me at
5-6676.
Mery

1. INTERNET STOCK OUTLOOK

By Jerry Yeung

Rising five of the past six sessions, the Nasdaq Composite Index pulled
within striking distance of its May 22 peak of 2328.05. For the week, the
tech-heavy index has risen 114.56, or 5.3%, to close at 2264 Thursday -
hurdling resistance at 2250.  All the while, the market has ignored renewed
signs of economic weakness and more warnings on the corporate front.
Instead, investors focused on the increased likelihood of more interest rate
cuts and shadowy signals that the worst of the downturn may have passed.
Confirming economic weakness alluded to in April durable goods orders, new
and existing home sales and purchasing managers' data for May, Tuesday's
numbers showed April factory orders fell a bigger-than-expected 3.0% and
first-quarter productivity was revised lower to minus-1.2%.

25-Basis Point Cut Expected at Next Meeting

In response to such weakness, the futures market has priced in a 100% chance
of a 25-basis point cut in interest rates when the Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) meets June 26 and 27. The market is giving just slight
consideration to a 50-point cut - likely in recognition of the 250-points
already slashed from the Fed funds rate since the beginning of the year.
Which leads us to a big reason for the market's recent rally. Flooded with
"cheap" money, investors appear willing to bet on a recovery in the second
half of the year - evident as they latch on to suggestion of the sort, while
ignoring blatantly negative warnings.  Two such examples of this were
chipmakers Broadcom (BRCM) and National Semiconductor (NSM), both rallying
after dismal earnings warnings Thursday. Both noted signs of stabilization
and hopes for a turnaround later this year.

Ailing telecom-equipment maker Lucent Technologies (LU) was an unlikely tech
giant reaffirming third-quarter guidance Tuesday, while semiconductor
kingpin Intel (INTC) reiterated its second-quarter guidance and predicted
"?a seasonally stronger second half" on Thursday.  With the market
apparently ready to take on the second-quarter earnings warning season, the
notion that Wall Street usually gears down for the summer months may prove
untrue - analogous to how many expected the market to outperform during the
winter months.

Chip Stocks Expected to Take the Lead

Thursday's exceptional strength among chip stocks, which powered the
Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up nearly 8% to just under 700 - a key
resistance level - may provide clues as to where the market goes from here.
It is generally accepted that movements in the chip sector lead the broader
market moves by about a month and the broader market leads the economy by
about six months.  While few believe that stocks are ready to return to
their heights, overly cautious strategies may miss some steady gains.

Next Week

The economic calendar is fairly heavy, with the May retail sales figures
scheduled for release Wednesday, the May Producer Price Index (PPI) Thursday
and the May Consumer Price Index (CPI), capacity utilization and industrial
production numbers on Friday.  Several tech firms are scheduled to check in
with earnings. Among them are NaviSite (NAVI), Engage (ENGA), CMGI (CMGI),
Leitch Technology (LVID) and Adobe Systems (ADBE).

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

On April 2nd, when everyone was calling for lower lows, we predicted
Dow support at the 9400-9450 area. Days later the market had rallied
from there an incredible 780 points!

Also, our Double-RePo pattern called the market top in January 2000,
before the recent bear market. This is when Joe suggested traders move
to cash etc.. It was a truly classic DiNapoli pattern, with excellent
advice from Joe too!

You can learn how these market calls were calculated
on the following web pages:

The project coordinators believe they can reach a solution with Accenture in which Enron pays no additional fees but the project is completed in a slightly scaled back form.  This allows Accenture to have a completed project and no more cash goes out the door.

The effort from the SME's should be complete by Christmas.  Please push forward with the review of the knowledge layer.

Phillip

Subject:	Zero Option


Phillip,


It will go along this lines: (Conservative)

*****************************************************
We pay "0" going forward
We have already played 300K in 3Q2001
Outstanding bill for $27,740 will hit Enron Q1, 2002

Enron and surviving entity will have the right to use it internally

We value Enrons SME time @ around 300K

Accenture will have the right to use it internally and modify the product at its will for internal & external use.

This arrangement will void 900K Enrons Revenue from Accenture

Enron would receive 0% royalty on all external sales.  I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter. Also,  I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved.

***********************************************************************

If we do not reach the agreement: 1. Terminate and pay around 500-600k (estimate)  The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or
				 2. Continue "as is" with payment differed for 90 days or merger.

We are sending Accenture official notice as of tomorrow we have 10 business days to workout solution or terminate.	

Any comments or suggestions?


Regards,

Yevgeny

Please send me an email describing the zero option so I can pass it along to the other SME's.

Importance:	High

Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM "core" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,


Yevgeny Frolov

 *  *  *  *  *    NOTE:  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING...   *  *  *  *  *


With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all Stentofon addresses in EB1 that are scheduled to move into ESC this year to a 5000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group of this change.

All Enron Broadband Stentofons will have their numbers changed to a 4000 series number.  (i.e.  If your Stento number was 576, then your new number will be 4576.)  

In summary, all Stentofon numbers will be changing this weekend.  If you are scheduled to move into ECS, then your Stento number will begin with a '5' and if you are to remain at EB1, then your Stento number will begin with a '4'.

Please inform all users of the Stentofon System of this change and pass this information to anyone that needs it.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

IN THE GTR, MAY 2001/The Great Divide

"Today Wall Street is telling the world that all information technology
companies are essentially the same. They may produce Internet
infrastructure, terabit routers, Ethernet hubs, or SONET (telco-standard,
optoelectronic) switches. They may manufacture cell phones or personal
computers or net appliances. But whatever they do, they sell "technology,"
and they all face a recession, a collapse of orders, and a capital dearth.

"This conventional wisdom is as wrong today as the similar view in the
mid-1980s that all the companies in the semiconductor and computer
industries were the same, that it didn't matter whether you invested in
Intel or Monolithic Memories, in Applied Materials or Applied
Microsystems, in Microsoft or Digital Equipment. A profound recession and
a stock market crash were said to be pushing the entire industry massively
to capital rich Japan and other Asian countries. To many observers, the
most glamorous remaining U.S. projects were supercomputer ventures such as
Cray Computer, Control Data, or Thinking Machines Corporation that were
multiplying compute-power in a single box to 10 billion operations per
second and above.

"What in fact was going on in 1985 was the opening of a Great Divide in
the computer industry. On one side were the companies achieving billions
of operations per second in a single computer; on the other side were
companies enabling production of hundreds of millions of computers. The
companies such as Control Data, Cray, and even IBM that focused on
performing billions of operations per second in a single costly box lost
to the companies that focused on enabling millions of people to use
computers: Intel, Microsoft, and Dell.

"Today a similar Great Divide is opening up in networks. It also revolves
around the key abundances and scarcities of an industry. This Great Divide
separates the companies performing the mostly empty stunt of multiplying
the number of inaccessible bits per second on a backbone fiber from the
companies multiplying the number of customers who can access the network.
It separates the companies focused on big, costly bandwidth from the
companies focused on cornucopian connectivity."

IN THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR/Art Laffer says "Boom!"

Supply-side prophet Arthur Laffer charts smooth sailing ahead.

Too often economists defer judgment on issues like the stock market
because the depth and breadth of the uncertainties are enormous.
Unfortunately, when economists do step aside they not only avoid making
mistakes, but they also deprive others of their insights. Economists do
have a lot about which to be modest, but they also have a great deal to
add.

Take the stock market, for example. A central concept in finance is that
the price of an asset is the discounted present value of that asset's
future earnings stream. While rarely employed in macroeconomics, this
concept, when judiciously applied to the overall U.S. economy, allows us
to evaluate the appropriate price for aggregate stock market--not too
shabby if true.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PETER HUBER/I, Silicon

"Microprocessors and bandwidth already substitute for military personnel
in outer space, and before long they'll take over the fighter jet and the
tank. But even as the human body ejects from the cockpit, the silicon
cockpit is infiltrating the body itself. The technologies that make
possible spy satellites and pilotless drones are moving into pacemakers,
defibrillators, hearing aids and a boundless new array of stimulators,
pumps and prostheses."

Digital Power Report co-editor Peter Huber's "From Silicon Cockpit to
Silicon Body" appears in the May 14th issue of Forbes. Read the full text

FRIDAY LETTER BONUS/David Gelertner's "The Second Coming"

"Any Microsecond Now

"Computing will be transformed. It's not just that our problems are big,
they are big and obvious. It's not just that the solutions are simple,
they are simple and right under our noses. It's not just that hardware is
more advanced than software; the last big operating-systems breakthrough
was the Macintosh, sixteen years ago, and today's hottest item is Linux,
which is a version of Unix, which was new in 1976. Users react to the hard
truth that commercial software applications tend to be badly-designed,
badly-made, incomprehensible and obsolete by blaming themselves
('Computers for Morons,' 'Operating Systems for Livestock'), and
meanwhile, money surges through our communal imagination like beer from
burst barrels. Billions. Naturally the atmosphere is a little strange;
change is coming, soon."

>From "The Second Coming - A Manifesto," by Yale computer visionary David
Gelernter. Originally published in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, June
2000. Read the full English text at

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, "live" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market "News" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. "storm in the gulf").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

UNCANNY 99.39% Accuracy and $730,566.72 Profits
. . . a Revolutionary Profit Miracle!

Andrew

Introducing - THE SCIENCE OF AUTOMATIC OPTION PROFITS

This shocking book reveals the most accurate and profitable
trading strategies I have ever seen - anywhere. With 491
wins out of 494 trades since May 1995, this is a virtual
sure-thing-profit secret!

In fact, in over 26 years in futures and options, I have
never seen a trading system that came so close to virtually
guaranteeing profits, trade - after - trade.

Win on at least 9 out of every 10 Trades
- Absolutely Guaranteed!

Now I've seen hundreds of trading systems claiming huge
profits - and most just self-destruct when put to the test.
That's why I immediately began following this
strategy...way back when I first learned of it.

The results blew me away! Every trade - every last one -
has been profitable since. Take a look for yourself.

The phenomenal record was no pipe dream. Trade after trade,
it has proven to be the trading system of a lifetime.

_____________________________________________________________________

LIVESTOCK: December live cattle closed up $0.65 at $67.95 today. The
big rally in the hogs supported the cattle futures today, as did
short covering. Prices scored a mildly bullish "outside day" up on
the daily bar chart today--whereby the high was higher and the low
was lower than the previous session's trading range, with a higher
close.

December lean hogs closed up $1.80 today at $49.65. A bullish monthly
USDA hogs and pigs report Friday-- showing a smaller pig crop than
last year--boosted futures sharply higher today. Ideas this week's
kill will be less than last week's also lent strength to futures
prices today.

GRAINS: December corn futures closed 2 cents lower at $2.03 1/2
today. Prices dropped to a fresh contract low today on fund selling.
The market feels pressure from harvest and uninspired demand. After
today's decline, I don't think there's much downside left in corn.

January soybeans closed unchanged at $4.34 1/4 today. More solid
export demand, in the form of strong weekly export inspections data
today, failed to push the market higher. While prices could retest
the contract lows scored last week, or even drop below them, I do
think the downside from present price levels is limited.

December Chicago SRW wheat closed off 3 3/4 cents at $2.91 1/4 today.
Prices backed off today on some profit

taking from the recent gains, and no chart damage was done today.
Prices Friday hit a fresh three-month high.

SOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 5 points higher at 6.77 cents today.
Prices closed near the session high. A fledging three-week-old
uptrend line is still intact on the daily bar chart--but just barely.
Bears still have the technical edge, overall.

December N.Y. coffee closed 25 points higher at 43.65 cents today.
Not much fresh news. The bears are in full command of coffee at
present. The only encouraging news to the bulls is the recent
increase in volatility at these lower price levels.

December N.Y. cocoa closed $2 higher today, at $997. There was enough
follow-through buying today to confirm a bullish key reversal on the
daily bar chart.

December cotton closed 8 points higher at 28.94 cents in

quiet trading today. Prices last week dropped down below key
long-term support at 29.50 cents. This opens the door to declines to
the 26-cent area, which is the lows seen in 1972, basis nearby
futures.

January orange juice on Friday afternoon closed at 90.65. That's up
155 points from the Thursday evening close. Prices gapped higher
Friday and bulls still have the big edge.

METALS: December COMEX gold futures closed up $1.40 at $279.70 an
ounce today. The weaker U.S. dollar helped the yellow metal today.
Prices are still seeing a corrective bounce in a bear market, but
bulls will take what they can get at present.

December silver futures closed $0.028 higher at $4.243 an ounce
today. Prices hit a fresh five-week low last week and bears have the
big edge.

December N.Y. copper closed 40 points lower at 63.10 cents. Prices
last week dropped to a contract low of 62.00 cents. Bears rule.

ENERGIES: December crude closed $0.10 higher at $22.15 today. It was
a fairly quiet day. The daily chart still looks bearish. However, the
longer the market trades sideways, the more that favors the bulls and
some "basing" activity.

December heating oil closed 33 points higher at .6337 today. It was a
quiet day today. The daily chart still looks bearish as prices hover
not that far above the recent lows.

December unleaded gasoline closed 8 points lower at .5873 today.
Prices scored a mildly bearish "outside day" down on the daily bar
chart today. The daily chart still looks

bearish.

December natural gas closed $0.177 higher at $3.36 today.

Prices scored a fresh seven-week high today. Prices last

week pushed up above a longer-term downtrend line on the daily bar
chart and today it was negated.

STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 125
points higher today at .9018. Bulls needed a day like today after the
bears knocked them around recently. Bears remain in control.

The December Japanese yen closed up 52 points at .8218 today. Today
saw a rebound in a bear market and bears rule. Prices pushed to a
three-month low last week.

The December Swiss franc closed 91 points higher at .6134 today.
Bulls needed today after their recent whipping. A steep five-week-old
downtrend line on the daily bar chart was penetrated on the upside
and negated today.

The December Canadian dollar closed 13 points higher at

.6351 today. Bears still rule as prices are in a four-month-old
downtrend on the daily bar chart.

The December British pound closed up 164 points at 1.4486 today.
Today's big gains negated a three-week-old downtrend line on the
daily bar chart and puts the bulls and bears back on a level playing
field, overall.

The September U.S. dollar index closed 119 points lower at

114.71 today. Prices gapped lower on the daily bar chart today and
they closed near the session low. Technical damage was done with
today's big downmove.

December U.S. T-bonds closed 10/32 higher at 108 1/32. The

bulls continue their push north as a new for-the-move

high was set today. Prices are at lofty levels, but there is nothing
on the daily chart that suggests prices cannot go farther north.

December S&P 500 futures closed off 28.50 at 1,073.50. Prices closed
near the session low today as trading has turned sideways and
choppier. Poor earnings reports, a weaker economic picture and an
increasing anthrax scare will limit upside moves.

How Did We Get Here?

Just like almost every other profession -- medicine,
law, and politics included -- affiliate marketing has a
checkered past. Worse, affiliate marketing seems to have a
checkered present. Where's the problem -- and the solution?
In corporate organizational structures.

An Affiliate Marketing Primer: Chapter III

You've set the affiliate program's objective and figured

measured the results, and marketed the program. What's
next? Care for and feed affiliates -- or if they're
fraudsters, weed them out.

Going Global With Internet Marketing

Global Internet marketing -- and the electronic commerce
associated with it -- is predicted to escalate dramatically
in the next several years. The possibilities are ever-so
pleasing. Yet some barriers are all-too real. The good news
is, they're surmountable.

Microsoft Rolls On, and Over, the Media

Hear that whacking? It's the sound of Microsoft snipping back its
marketing budget. With press clips like Redmond's been getting, why
spend the money?

Microsoft's stock is up 60 percent this year, and the software giant
plans to roll out a string of new products, making Bill Gates a popular
cover boy for Fortune and Business Week. The only thing missing
from their reviews of his company's elaborate plans is scrutiny.

"Just about any software application on your PC and even on your cell
phone or PDA will tap directly into interactive services to make work
and life easier to manage," Fortune enthused, pointing out without the
slightest hint of irony that since there's no business model for the
subscription software services that Microsoft is drooling over,
Redmond will simply have to invent one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Trouble in the Dysfunctional Staples Family

Despite the fact that shareholders, the media and now a Delaware
judge all agree that Staples has "issues," the company continues to
blissfully blab to the media that all is well in its humble home.

IPO rip-off stories are everywhere these days, as federal and state
agencies pick up the pace on investigating them, but it's not just the
investment bankers who are finding trouble for their greedy ways. As
Business Week reported last week, Walt Disney Internet Group, NBCi
and CSFBdirect all have caused a ruckus by boomeranging back to
their parents' homes, and the story of Staples.com is no different.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Russell 3000 Is Changing - Why Do We Care?

News flash: The preliminary report on the Russell 3000's annual
re-jiggering of its stock index comes out Friday at market close.
Reporters expect to witness a slew of pipsqueak dot-com stocks falling
out of the index, but for all the coverage the alleged event is getting,
they can't agree on whether it matters.

PUNDITS SAY THE DARNDEST THINGS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
David Simons, Forbes.com

Upshot: You're not paying attention, Net investors.

Hello? Is Anyone Out There? First, e-mail marketer MessageMedia
sold itself to DoubleClick for $41 million in stock - a tidy 40 percent
premium over its May 31 closing price. Then MyPoints.com cozied up
with United Airlines for three times as much and a 63 percent
premium to its June 1 close. And yet, not a peep of enthusiasm from
Net investors or a budge upward in the stocks of similar dot-coms.

Sure, Now They Shut Up: "Analysts who still cover the Internet
direct-marketing outfits avoided calls seeking explanation for the
market yawn. Maybe the analysts are embarrassed. These stocks are
pipsqueaks that once were bubble Blutos."

Rip van Winkle.com: Stock market bulletin-board traffic about the
deals was remarkably light. Investors' "ennui about the recent deals
seems to reflect that they're just plain tuckered out."

Investors Shrug at Internet Buyout Deals
http://www.forbes.com/2001/06/06/0606simons.html


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Ken Kurson, Esquire

Upshot: When it comes to Cisco, are you in or out?

Then Again, Maybe It's Just Foolhardy: Cisco Systems' positives are
that it has no debt and it's a leader in its markets. The fact that it's
sticking by its official prediction of between 30 percent and 50 percent
revenue growth going forward "is encouraging."

Inventories Are Fat But Not Happy: Everyone's got more of Cisco's
products than they need. That goes for its customers and Cisco's own
inventory levels. Then there are those holdings: In Q2, the company
lost $3.5 billion; in last year's Q2, it gained $1 billion. If, as Cisco says,
its holdings resemble the Nasdaq, and if the market continues to
deteriorate, Cisco will take a double hit.

Do You Believe? "If you told me last year that you'd sell me your $80
shares of Cisco for $16, I would have bought all I could. I still would.
A bet on Cisco is a signature on a contract that says, 'I believe in the
long-term future of the Internet as a vital and paradigm-changing
invention,' and I definitely believe that. No Internet-equipment
company is better run, more central, or a fiercer competitor. At $16,
it's not quite a steal, but it's a bargain."

Catch of the Day: Balance of power

The California power grid is finally getting some official
attention from the federal government. When President Bush
was in Los Angeles a week ago, he met with Governor Gray
Davis, and also with 13 business leaders, to discuss the
energy situation here.

As widely reported, the Democrats' response to the visit was
not positive, since Mr. Bush declined to favor price
controls to help ease California's power bill.

However, Mr. Bush's reluctance means opportunity for
entrepreneurs. One of the 13 attendees at the energy
roundtable was John Woolard, CEO of Silicon Energy. He told
me that Mr. Bush, who clearly trusts the supply side to
modulate prices, appeared extremely interested in the
ability Silicon Energy has to "send price signals" into the
system. John's company makes energy monitoring systems; he
has a technological solution for the free market.

John has something for the Dems, too: he said Governor Davis
is keen to install Silicon Energy's systems into state
buildings. That's not surprising, since without federal
assistance, California's government is going to have a
pretty big power bill itself.

Energy management makes sense even absent politics. So I
hope that after the crisis is over, we continue to use power
more intelligently.

Hello All -- Attached is a memo highlighting the issue areas covered by staff at the ICC meeting in Chicago yesterday.  If you have any questions feel free to call.  It was strange to hear Tom Kennedy say that staff supports reasonable hedging practices and forward contract purchases while sitting next to Zuraski who opposed recovery of same in the PGLC fixed price docket.  Incidentally, Tom Kennedy noted several times that hedging will not necessarily reduce prices but will stabilize them.

Hello Andy.

I hope your Monday is going well. Per our discussion last week, I have
communicated to our management your limited availability for this project.
Hopefully we will resolve this issue in the upcoming week. Our plan is to
request additional resources to help you write the content. However, you
will still be responsible for signing off on the final product. I will keep
you updated with more information as soon as I know more.

In the meantime and until we've identified additional resources, I am
sending you  the high-level outline for each content area that you are
responsible for this week. Let me know if you have time to complete this,
or any other past assignment. I've included reminders below on where/how to
develop.  Thanks.

Website:

of the following areas:
1) Market Valuation (Page 1_5_4_1-   in the Swaps topic)
2) Cross-Commodity Swap (Page 1_6_6_1 - in the Swaps topic)

Due Date: Friday, November 2nd, 2001

Outlines to Help Guide You When Writing
Market Valuation (Forwards)
<<Andy - This section should provide examples/scenarios to the learner to
help better explain how market volatility impacts P&L when using Forwards
Contracts>>
   Short in the forwards market: rising prices result in losses and
   decreasing prices result in profits
   Long in the forwards market: rising prices result in profits and
   decreasing prices result in losses
   Examples/scenarios

Cross-Commodity Swap
<<Andy, this is a larger section. You can copy/paste most of the
information regarding cross-commodity swaps from the BRM course material
that we sent you.>>
   Definition of Cross-Commodity Swap
   Definition of differenty types of cross-commodity swaps:
     Crack Spread Swap
     Spark Spread Swap
     Btu Swap
   Constructing a cross-commodity swap
   Examples/scenarios with Monthly cash settlements

Finally and most importantly, please keep in mind that the completion of
these assignments significantly impacts the the ability of our BRM project
to stay on schedule and within budget. If you are unable to complete this
assignment, please notify me ahead of time and provide an estimated time
for completion.

Thank you.

Dear Gordon,
Let me help you improve Continental:
I have called customer service three times in order to receive a
confirmation of my upcoming flight.  I have asked for an eticket
confirmation sent to me via regular mail and an e-mail.  My flight is now
nine days away, and I still haven't received any confirmation.  If you
can't handle the simple task of sending a letter or an e-mail, how can I
trust you to run an airline?

This is not the first time I have had problems with your company.  After
having used the online services of American; United; and Continental, I
have found your service to be vastly inferior.

Although it is difficult to avoid Continental when flying out of Houston,
I am going to do my best from now on.
Would you like a response from someone at Continental? Yes

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

The STOCK INDEXES closed lower on Friday as today's halt in trading
on the big board due to software problems caused nervous traders and
investors to dump stocks ahead of the weekend. This led to the
posting of a key reversal down in September S&P's and a lower close
in the Nasdaq. Additional weakness in both markets on Monday would
increase the odds that the corrective bounces off the late-May lows
might have run their course for the time being.

The Dow closed lower on Friday due in part to today's software
glitch, which halted trading on the big board for the first time
since 1998. Nervous traders dumped stocks due to uncertainties over
the half in trading as the decline off Tuesday's high continues.
Momentum indicators have turned bearish with this week's setback
signaling that additional weakness is possible. Closes below last
week's low crossing at 10,835.40 would renew the Dow's decline off
May's high and set the stage for a test of May's low crossing at
10,673.20 later this month.

INTEREST RATES September bonds closed lower on Friday thereby
confirming Thursday's key reversal down. Today's decline turned a
number of momentum indicators neutral to bearish hinting that the
corrective bounce off the late-May low might have come to an end with
Thursday's high. Additional weakness on Monday could lead to an
eventual test of broken trendline resistance drawn across this
spring's highs.

The CRB INDEX posted a key reversal up on Friday erasing all of this
week's losses in the process. Strength in oilseeds, hogs, bellies,
some precious metals, foods, fiber and crude oil underpinned today's
rally. Today's high-range close leaves the door open for a steady to
higher opening on Monday as closes above 211.75 would renew the
rebound off the late-May low crossing at 208.43. Momentum indicators
are oversold and are turning neutral warning bears to use caution, as
additional short covering is possible during June.

ENERGY MARKETS closed higher on Friday due to short covering as they
consolidated some of this week's losses ahead of the weekend. Gains
were limited as worries over refinery snags and crude oil offloading
affected by stormy weather in the U.S. Gulf dissipated.

July crude oil rebounded on Friday erasing all of this week's losses
to post a positive close for the week. Momentum indicators are
oversold and turning neutral to bullish hinting that a short-term low
was posted with Wednesday's spike of this year's uptrend line. It
will take closes above 29.05 to temper the near-term bearish outlook
in the market.

July heating oil posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday
due to short covering ahead of the weekend. Closes above this week's
high at 78.40 would confirm that Wednesday's low marked a double
bottom, which coincides with the 38% retracement level of the
December/May rally crossing at 75.66.

July unleaded gas closed slightly higher on Friday as it extended
Thursday's short covering bounce following this week's trendline
breakout. Session lows tested the 50% retracement level crossing at
88.93. This week's trendline breakout has opened the door for
additional weakness during June. If the decline resumes, the 62%
retracement level of this year's rally crossing at 85.62 is July's
next target. The daily ADX (a trend-following indicator) remains in a
bearish mode signaling that additional weakness is possible.

July Henry Hub natural gas posted a key reversal up on Friday due to
light short covering ahead of the weekend. Forecasts calling for a
warm-up across the Midwest next week and continued heat in the South
are expected to raise demand for natural gas, which triggered today's
rally. Closes above 4.179 or below 3.67 are needed to clear up
near-term direction in the market.

CURRENCIES The September Dollar closed slightly higher on Friday as
it continues to grind sideways to higher this spring. The daily ADX
(a trend-following indicator) is bullish signaling that additional
strength is possible as the door remains open for a test of weekly
resistance crossing at 121.50 later this month. It would take closes
below May's uptrend line crossing near 118.62, which coincides with
gap support to signal that a short-term top has likely been posted.

The September Swiss Franc closed slightly higher on Friday due to
light short covering ahead of the weekend. September continues to
consolidate above the contract lows but remains poised to renew this
spring's decline possibly next week. Wednesday's key reversal down is
still a warning to traders that the underlying tone of the market
remains weak. The daily ADX is still in a bearish trend mode
signaling that additional weakness is possible.

The September Canadian Dollar extended this week's rally as it spiked
above the 62% retracement level of this winter's decline crossing at
.6573. If this resistance level is clear, gap resistance beginning at
.6600 is September's next upside target. Closes below broken
resistance crossing at .6541 would increase the odds that a
short-term top has likely been posted. Momentum indicators are
bullish but overbought warning bulls to use caution as a short-term
top might be near.

The September Japanese Yen renewed this week's decline with a lower
close on Friday. The setback from last week's high has returned
September to this spring's trading range. Momentum indicators have
turned bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices during the
first half of June are possible. If the decline continues, gap
support crossing at .8272 is September's next target.

PRECIOUS METALS August gold vaulted sharply higher on Friday due to
short covering. Trading volume was thin, which helped exaggerate
today's gains. Nevertheless, a short-term bottom has been confirmed
with the recent consolidation around the 75% retracement level of
this spring's rally crossing at 267.20. Today's rally turned
short-term momentum indicators bullish signaling that additional
gains into mid-June are possible. A setback is likely on Monday as
today's gains were overdone.

July silver also closed higher on Friday as it posted a key reversal
up. Session lows tested trading range support crossing at 4.31 cents.
Stochastics and RSI are bearish but oversold hinting that a
short-term bottom may have been posted with today's low. Additional
gains on Monday are needed to help confirm today's bullish reversal
pattern. Closes below 4.31 would open the door for a possible test of
weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month.

July copper plunged to new contract lows and below weekly support
crossing at 74.10 as it renewed this spring's decline. Weekly support
crossing at 72.85 is July's next target. Stochastics and RSI are
bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible.
Today's sell off was triggered by fund liquidation due to concerns
over the global economy.

GRAINS July corn closed lower on following Thursday's poor close and
weekend weather forecast for the Midwest, which should allow for a
warm up that should spur improved crop development next week. Losses
were limited due to dry weather concerns in China and expectations
that next Monday's crop conditions report will come in steady to
slightly below this week's levels. Momentum indicators remain bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices into mid-June are possible.
Closes above minor resistance at $2.00 are needed to set the stage
for a possible test of May's high at 2.11 1/2 later this month.

July wheat closed fractionally lower on Friday as it consolidated
some of its late-week gains. Losses were limited due to reports of
heavy rains across parts of the hard red winter wheat belt overnight,
which raised concerns about further crop losses. Gains this week
remains limited due to sluggish world wheat demand and U.S. winter
wheat harvest, which has moved into southern Oklahoma. Closes above
2.72 or below 2.58 1/2 is needed to clear up near-term direction in
the market. Stochastics are giving a divergent buy signal hinting
that sideways to higher prices are possible next week.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans posted its highest close since March
13th as it extends its trading range breakout. The stage is set for a
test of March's high crossing at 4.77 1/2. Continued strength in the
cash markets along with strong foreign and domestic demand continues
to underpin the late-spring rally. Commodity funds were active buyers
across the complex buying about 1,000 contracts of soybeans. Momentum
indicators remain bullish signaling that additional gains are
possible.

July soybean meal closed sharply higher on Friday and above the 62%
retracement level crossing at 169.40 to keep this spring's uptrend
alive. Today's breakout above fib resistance has opened the door for
a possible test of the 75% retracement level of this winter's decline
crossing at 175.40 later this month. Strong foreign and domestic
demand along with a tight cash market continues to underpin meal's
rally. The daily ADX has resumed its bullish trend mode signaling
that additional strength is possible.

LIVESTOCK August hogs closed sharply higher on Friday falling just
short of the contract high at 65.95. Fund related buying along with
local short covering triggered today's rally due to tight supplies
and ideas of firming cash bids and higher cut-out values. Additional
support came from the Goldman roll as they continue to buy the August
contract. This week's rally has turned weekly momentum indicators
bullish signaling that additional gains are possible. I would not be
surprised to see a brief period of consolidation around 65.95 next
week.

August cattle gave us the short covering bounce ahead of the weekend
that I was looking for as it consolidated some of this week's losses.
While additional short covering is possible on Monday, momentum
indicators have turned bearish warning traders that last week's high
likely marked a broad double top with January's high. Expectations
for seasonal weakness during June should continue to put pressure on
August cattle next week.

FOOD & FIBER July coffee closed slightly higher on Friday due to
short covering ahead of the weekend. July's ability to hold above the
late-May low of 57.10 leaves the door open for a short covering
bounce next week should weather forecasts for Brazil's coffee growing
region turn bullish. Momentum indicators are oversold hinting that a
short-term low is in place or near. Closes above 60.80 are needed to
temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market.

July cocoa posted an upside reversal with a higher close on Friday
due to short covering ahead of the weekend. July's inability to
sustain Thursday's move to new lows hints that a short-term low might
be in place. Stochastics and RSI are oversold warning traders not to
press the short side of the market at this time.

July sugar closed higher on Friday erasing the losses of the past two
trading sessions. While today's bounce was expected, it does bring
into question whether or not the rebound off last week's double
bottom has ended or if there is one more leg up in the correction
before the larger-degree decline off May's high resumes. Momentum
indicators are bearish but nearing their respective oversold zones
warning bears to use caution and not to press the short side of the
market at this time.

July cotton closed out the week on a high note as it continues to
rebound off the late-May lows. However, floor sources indicate that
there has been little fundamental news to support this month's short
covering rally, which leaves the market vulnerable to a resumption of
this year's decline later this month. Stochastics and RSI have turned
bullish signaling that additional short covering into mid-June is
possible. If the rebound continues, trendline resistance crossing
near 43.25 is the next target.

IN NEW ECONOMY WATCH/Snowflakes or Scuds?

"If the mainstream press is right, now is a good time to keep your
money--at least, the portion of it that you allocate to the
telecommunications carrier and service provider industries--under the
mattress. There's a house of cards that's about to come crashing down, and
you don't want to be anywhere near the neighborhood. "Telecom Debt Debacle
Could Lead To Losses Of Historic Proportions!" shouted page C1 of the May
11 Wall Street Journal, capping a wild month of "Can You Top This?"
financial headlines. The Journal story followed close on the heels of
"Telecom Meltdown," an April 23 Business Week Special Report, a pair of
Barron's pieces featuring or highlighting Susan Kalla, the "Dr. Doom Of
Telecommunications," and a widely read TheStreet.com interview with former
Lehman Brothers' bond analyst Ravi Suria, who boldly predicted that "80%
of the New Economy telcos will have to restructure." Kalla and Suria, not
surprisingly, recommend that investors steer well clear of both the stocks
and the bonds of telecommunications companies.

"The Journal says that the telecom shakeout is "shaping up to be one of
the biggest financial fiascoes ever," citing $650 billion in debt
financing over the "past few years." Barron's counts $322 billion in such
financing over the past three years, and Business Week ($700 billion)
suggests ominously that "the end of the dark days of telecom...are still a
long way off." If those big numbers aren't scary enough, the Journal is
there to remind us that "in the past six months, about ten telecom
providers have filed for bankruptcy." The implication is that dozens more
are set up to follow in their footsteps. If you want to hear their names
repeated over and over again in that context, just turn on the television.

"Take a few spectacular corporate flameouts, add a relentless flow of
reportorial negativity, throw in some fire-and-brimstone preachiness--from
Wall Street, of all places--about purging excesses (whatever those are)
and punishing profligate offenders, and you wind up with an investor class
that behaves like Mark Twain's cat; which, having once found itself aboard
a hot stove, would not only never visit a hot stove again, but wouldn't
dare jump on a cold one either.

"Should you follow the cats? To mix up our menagerie a bit: can you count
on Chicken Little to tell a Scud from a snowflake?"

IN THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR/Hack This

"Before all else, I must establish two facts: first, I am a
'hacker'--i.e., someone who knows and enjoys computer programming. Second,
I grew up in Europe. Owing to one of the sillier rules of political
correctness, 'speaking as a Hungarian-born hacker,' I have now the
authority to say all kinds of critical things about the Finnish Pekka
Himanen and his new book 'The Hacker Ethic.'

"On the other hand, I also work at Microsoft, which, according to the
book, is the 'computer hacker's number-one enemy.' This, by the same
rules, would disqualify me as hopelessly biased. So let's just suspend the
rules, and I'll say what I think."

June 2001's American Spectator is on newsstands now, featuring Brian
Wesbury on Alan Greenspan, Joe Queenan on Boomer funerals and Art Laffer's
strong buy on Japan. Oh, and an interview with someone named George
Gilder. Plus Microsoft Distinguished Engineer Charles Simonyi's unhedged
dissection of the open-source software scene, Rich Karlgaard on venture
capital and a cover girl who'll never be confused with Hillary Clinton.

FRIDAY FEATURE/Raving Loony Supply Siders

"High marginal tax rates distort work and savings decisions, and promote
unproductive tax avoidance and evasion activities. These tax distortions
create 'deadweight losses,' which lower the nation's standard of living.
Each $1 of marginal tax rate cuts would save the private economy at least
$1.25 as deadweight losses fall and economic efficiency increases."

More ravings from the supply side? Actually it's a rare blast of fresh air
from Capitol Hill-"The Economic Benefits of Personal Income Tax Rate
Reductions," published last month by the Joint Economic Committee, Senior
Economist Chris Edwards presiding. Your tax dollars at work! Get a free
copy at http://www.house.gov/jec/tax/taxrates/taxrates.pdf .

tipped the report in her "After Tax" column,

mirror telegraphy, aka the Heliograph, the Helioscope, the Heliostat, the

The Dead Media Project is an ever-expanding database of, well, dead media.
Television isn't there yet, but the early Baird mechanical version is

stick, a complete list of deceased PC platforms and pneumatic typewriters.
Loosely maintained by science-fiction--okay, cyberpunk--eminence Bruce
Sterling and powered by a global network of volunteers, it's the kind of
ramshackle monument to unfettered communication that makes Web pioneers
misty. The "table of categories" alone is a geek feast. There is no way
adequately describe this. The good news is that we don't have to--it's at

HotToday: Futures - http://ctsTrader.com

______June the 9th, 2001__________
-------------------------------------------------------
CTS HOT TODAY: FUTURES
By Nick Van Nice
-------------------------------------------------------
_________Volume 3, Number 114___________

Good morning everyone, the purpose of CTS Hot Today: Futures
is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead.
--------------------------------------------------------
Nick's Trading Tip of the Day (06/09)
--------------------------------------------------------
"Trade interest rates and currencies different than
tangible commodity markets"

Ever since interest rate and currency futures were launched
back in the early eighties and late seventies respectively, they
have proven themselves to be superior trending vehicles.

Why is this? Is there a rational explanation that makes good
sense? In my opinion, it's because of the broad universe of
decision-making minds and the slave role the futures play to
a much larger cash market.

Think about it, the whole world participates in the pricing
of currencies 24 hours a day 7 days a week. When a new trend emerges
you have individuals, companies and governments that are impacted and
it may take months to unfold before a trend pauses significantly.
The same can be said for interest rate futures.

Compare them to tangible commodity markets and you'll quickly see a
huge fundamental difference. For example, take the grains for instance.
You've got a handful of big commercial players like Cargill, ADM,
GPC and a several large commodity funds and then thousands of small
speculators. The funds and speculators react to price trends and
momentum and pretty much see the same things within a one to two
day period. The commercials all have access to the same fundamental
data and act quickly move in concert to hedge. News such as weather
forecasts and technical factors are quickly discounted and then
there's nothing left to drive the trend. You then get some profit
taking or light hedging coming in and you get a volatile market that
oscillates above and below it's 40-day ma.

I recommend trading the currencies and interest rates on a longer
term position trading basis, utilizing some form of a lagging exit.
The CTS TrendSetter has proven this technique effective over the
past 20 years. (And by the way, CTS TrendSetter is now included in
our new GOLD package on ctsTrader.com).

On the other hand, when trading other markets, I like to use a swing
trading approach designed to take profits at targets. The other
dimension that's critical, is aiming for a high percentage of
winners. Since these markets rarely sustain big tradeable moves,
it pays to take profits after short term swings, which leads to
a high percentage of winners. This inturn lowers the risk of
having a large consecutive losing streak and that leads to
longevity. I like this approach so much that we built a dedicated
Swing Trader advisory service just for Bond & Currency Trading.

Food for thought. Let's get ready for a great week!

******* Interviews with S.T.A.R. Analysts *******
Suppose you were sitting in a room with Nick Van Nice, Glen
Ring, Joe Lesko, and Andy Chambers. And suppose they were
thoroughly detailing their favorite short-term strategies that

-Andy Chambers- futures options specialist, technical analyst,
and a great educator on short-term option strategies.

options in 1968- 5 years BEFORE there was a CBOE.

group represents more than 90 years of cumulative experience
watching the markets. Unless you started following the markets

Key Technical Developments (close of 06/08)
-------------------------------------------------------
I'm watching that disappointing close on the DOW, on a
Friday, now sitting just below the 10 Day Moving Average.
Then I'm looking at potential support from the 40 Day at about
10867 and the strong bullish trend of that 40 Day. We could
see a slide down to that 40 day, but it should act as
support. We might expect a strong bounce upwards from this
level of important support. A key tool that adds much
confidence is our exclusive "breadth" indicator known
as the CTS PowerTrend rating. It is currently at +11. We
update the PowerTrend rating every day in the CTS Dow
Selector and watching it can give you a powerful snapshot
of short-term strength (or weakness) of the DOW (we also
have the PowerTrend on the Futures, NASDAQ, and S&P
Selectors too!).

July cotton has tried to correct some of the recent
decline. A very weak market, with weak intra market
spreads. The price pattern takes the shape of a bear
flag. A move below support of 41.50, points to 37.50.
(We also cover key resistance levels in today's Daily
Trend Watch in the Advisory menu, Futures, Daily Trend
Watch at ctsTrader.com. In addition, I share 3 HOT
picks for next week that you don't won't to miss.

COMMENT: I believe the Fed made a mistake on Tuesday. The 50-basis-point cut
in the federal funds rate was not necessary at this time. That was the
message from the bond market (rising yields), the yield curve (steepening
slope), and the stock market (rebounding prices) following the previous rate
cut on April 18. More recently, the rising prices of gold and gold stocks
also confirm the growing market consensus that the Fed may be easing too
much. The rapid growth in M2 also suggests that the Fed has done enough to
revive economic growth later this year, and may now be overshooting on the
easing side.

My main issue with the Fed's latest move isn't the rate cut itself, but
rather the press release that explained the reasons for the action. It was
almost a carbon copy of the statement issued by the Fed following the
previous rate cut on April 18. The message is that the economic risks are
still on the downside and that monetary policy is still biased to ease. In
my opinion, the message should have observed that the federal funds rate has
been cut five times in five months by 250 basis points to 4%, and that this
might be enough for now. The message should have been biased toward a
neutral monetary policy stance.

In my comment this past Sunday, I wrote, "Now, the Fed is providing easy
money to minimize the pain resulting from the bursting of Bubble I, which
seems to be setting the stage for Bubble II." Stock investors agreed with
this conclusion on Wednesday, a day after the Fed folks cut the federal
funds rate yet again. They understand that the Fed's rush to ease credit
conditions may not revive economic growth as quickly as the monetary
authorities would like. Instead, the resulting flood of liquidity is likely
to pour into the stock market.

Indeed, both the April 18 and May 15 statements clearly implied that Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues now want to promote a positive
wealth effect in the stock market to boost consumer spending. This is quite
a reversal from early last year, when the Fed Chairman worried that the
soaring stock market was pushing consumer demand above available supply.

Here is the relevant excerpt from the May 15 statement: "The erosion in
current and prospective profitability, in combination with considerable
uncertainty about the business outlook, seems likely to hold down capital
spending going forward. This potential restraint, together with the possible
effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk
of slower growth abroad, continues to weigh on the economy."

Here is the relevant excerpt from the April 18 statement: "Nonetheless,
capital investment has continued to soften and the persistent erosion in
current and expected profitability, in combination with rising uncertainty
about the business outlook, seems poised to dampen capital spending going
forward. This potential restraint, together with the possible effects of
earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower
growth abroad, threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably
weak."

The message is loud and clear: The Fed folks believe that the negative
equity wealth effect they helped to engineer over the past year has gone too
far. A rebound in stock prices is now welcome. The Fed's welcome wagon is
stocked with lots of bottles of champagne, and the speculators are drinking
the liquidity with gusto. The bubbly is bringing back irrational exuberance
fast. (For a complete history of the Fed's policy statements see
http://www.yardeni.com/FOMC.asp.)

As I stated in my Sunday comment, I like bubbles. You can make lots of money
very quickly when a bubble is inflating, as long as you get out just before
it bursts. As of yesterdays close, the S&P 500 was 25% overvalued based on
the Fed's Stock Valuation Model (FSVM). Five more percentage points and the
market will be as overvalued as it was just before the 1987 crash, though it
would still be cheaper than at the start of last year when it was 70%
overvalued. But that was Bubble I. Bubble II may surpass the 1987
overvaluation, but I suspect it will burst somewhere below the 70% level.

My asset allocation model, which is based on the FSVM, suggests that the
right stocks/bonds mix whenever the market is more than 20% overvalued is a
very conservative 60/40. (The recommended mix is 70/30 whenever the market
is 10% to 20% overvalued.) For the past few weeks, I have hesitated to lower
my stocks/bonds recommended mix from 80/20 because the Fed's liquidity party
is likely to drive stock prices up further. In addition, the sober bond
vigilantes are back trying to offset the Fed's easing policy by pushing
yields up. (For a weekly update of the FSVM, see
http://www.yardeni.com/public/stkvalu.pdf.)

If the 30-year Treasury yield rises closer to 6.5% and stocks become more
than 30% overvalued, which seems increasingly likely over the next few
months, then I may go to 70/30. If I think we are close to bursting Bubble
II, I'll suggest 60/40.

The Fed is certainly our friend. However, true friends don't let their
friends drink and drive. I would prefer an earnings-driven bull market
rather than a liquidity-driven one. For now: May the bubble be with you!

NEW ON SITE: For those of you, who still care about fundamental analysis,
please have a look at our new, improved EARNINGS MONTH with "Squiggles
Inside!" This publication includes our unique Earnings Squiggles analysis
for all eleven sectors of the S&P 500 and now 49 selected industries. You'll
find that P/Es are quite high and that earnings prospects are subdued in
many industries, especially Technology and Consumer Staples.
(http://www.yardeni.com/public/em_010516.pdf)

In the latest EARNINGS WEEK, Joe Abbott and I examine and compare the latest
earnings expectations for the S&P large, mid, and small cap sectors. Here is
one of our findings: "All three S&P market cap groups are expected to record
a decline in Q2 earnings. Although Q2 earnings had been expected to decline
for the S&P 500 since the beginning of the year, it was only in the past
month that S&P Mid Cap 400 and S&P Small Cap 600 expectations fell into
negative territory."

The KEY WEEKLY drop-down box on the HOME page now includes charts on
Earnings and Valuation. The FED WATCHER has been expanded. Debbie Johnson's
StrategyFax is better than ever with instant analyses of the latest industry
developments. (Ask your DBAB sales rep to receive this by fax or email.)

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stock indexes closed lower on Wednesday amidst heavy institutional
selling by Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. Trading volume was thin,
which may have exaggerated some of today's losses. Nevertheless, both
indexes posted new lows for the month thereby leaving the doors open
for additional weakness into mid-February. The NASDAQ closed down
25.80 points at 1812.72 and below the 38% retracement level of the
September/January rally. If the decline continues, November's
reaction low crossing at 1782.48 marks the next level of support. The
March S&P 500 index also closed lower on Tuesday and below the 38%
retracement level of the September/January rally crossing at 1087.97.
The door is open for a possible test of the late-October low crossing
at 1060.60 later this month. March closed down 5.70 points at
1083.30.

The Dow posted a quiet inside day with a lower close on Wednesday.
Losses were limited as Cisco Systems rekindled investor confidence in
U.S. companies with word that second- quarter results will exceed
current estimates. However, investors remain very nervous about
current stock valuations amidst suspicions over corporate accounting
irregularities. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that
additional weakness is likely on Thursday that could lead to a test
of last week's low crossing at 9529.40. If this support level is
broken, it would open the door for a possible test of long-term fib
support crossing at 9318.20 later this month.

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

March T-bonds posted an inside day with a lower close on Wednesday
amidst a relatively quiet session on Wall Street. Additional pressure
came from lower than expected participation of an auction of 10-year
notes. March continues to consolidate below January's high crossing
at 104-11. If this resistance level is cleared, January's high
crossing at 105-06 is a potential target later this month.
Stochastics and a number of other short-term momentum indicators are
bullish but diverging, which is often a precursor to a top and trend
change.

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

The CRB index posted a key reversal down on Wednesday as it was
pressured by weakness in energies, grains, hogs, bellies and some
precious metals. Wednesday's rally was halted dead in its tracks
following a spike of January's downtrend line crossing near 190.50.
The CRB's failure to close above this resistance level and the
previous reaction high crossing at 190.29 is short-term bearish and
leaves the door open for additional weakness for the balance of the
week. At the same time, stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish
hinting that last week's low might have marked a mid-winter low.

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

The energy markets closed lower on Tuesday following this week's
bearish inventory reports and sluggish demand. Additional pressure
came from a report out of Kuwait that it will resume oil exports from
its northern fields just one week after an explosion shut down one
third if its output.

March crude oil closed lower for the third day in a row thereby
increasing the odds that last Friday's high marked the upper boundary
of a late-winter trading range. Additional weakness later this week
would turn a number of short-term momentum indicators neutral to
bearish thereby signaling that sideways to lower prices might be
possible into mid-February. It remains unlikely that March will
breakout above the upper boundary of this winter's trading range
crossing at 22.50 in the near future.

March heating oil closed lower on Wednesday as it extended this
week's sell off from last Friday's high. This week's bearish
inventory report along with bearish extended weather forecast for the
high-demand regions of the U.S. continues to weigh on prices. March
heating oil has fallen back into January's trading range and in doing
so has turned a number of short-term momentum indicators neutral to
bearish. I would not be surprised to see March heating oil breakout
below this winter's trading range as it posts a new contract low
later this month.

March unleaded gas closed sharply lower on Wednesday retracing just
over 50% of last week's rebound since Monday. Rising inventories and
weak demand continue to offset the approach of seasonal trend changes
in the market. Stochastics and the RSI turned bearish with today's
weakness signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible during
the first half of February.

March Henry Hub natural gas closed slightly higher due to short
covering ahead of this afternoon's AGA inventory report on Wednesday.
This afternoon's report showed a draw of 82 billion cubic feet of
natural gas taken from storage, the low end of expectations. This
could limit if not pressure prices on Thursday as the market still
has over 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas hanging over the
market.

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

The March Dollar posted a potential downside reversal on Wednesday
after early strength tied to short covering faded into the close.
However, the near mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways
trading on Thursday. March needs to close below Monday's low crossing
at 118.96 to confirm a breakout below January's uptrend line. Until
then, I caution anyone against becoming too bearish despite the
overbought condition of the market.

The March Swiss Franc remained within Tuesday's trading range but
closed higher on Wednesday due to short covering. Today's close above
last week's high crossing at .5898 increases the odds that a double
bottom with December's low was posted last week. However, closes
above this winter's downtrend line crossing near .6010 are needed
before this can be confirmed. This week's rebound has turned the
daily ADX bullish signaling that additional short covering is
possible. Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways
trading on Thursday. I would caution anyone from becoming too bullish
this market until this winter's downtrend line has been broken.

The March Canadian Dollar closed sharply lower on Wednesday, which
led to a test of January's uptrend line crossing near .6230 and
coincides with previous support. Closes below .6230 would signal an
end to this winter's short covering bounce while opening the door for
sideways to lower prices into mid-February. This week's setback has
turned stochastics and the RSI bearish thereby increasing the odds
for sideways to lower prices near-term.

The March Japanese Yen closed slightly higher on Wednesday as it
consolidated some of Tuesday's loss. The March yen is at a crossroads
and will need to close above last fall's downtrend line crossing near
.7600 or below last week's low crossing at .7416 to clear up
near-term direction in the market. If this winter's decline resumes,
weekly support crossing at .7371 is March's next target.

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

April gold closed slightly lower on Wednesday amidst profit taking.
Early strength was due to spillover buying interest due to a
breakdown in investor confidence over the valuation of equity prices.
However, a relatively quiet trading day on Wall Street triggered a
round profit taking following April's break out into new contract
highs on Tuesday. Aprils could spend the balance of this week
consolidating above broken resistance crossing at 297.50. If the
rally resumes later this month, weekly resistance crossing at 322 is
April's next target. Momentum indicators are bullish but becoming
overbought warning bulls that a rebound in the equity markets could
trigger a round of long-liquidation as skittish investors rotate
capital out of gold and back into stocks.

March silver posted a downside reversal on Wednesday. Overnight
strength fell just short of testing the 50% retracement level of
January's decline crossing at 4.492. However, a lack of panic selling
in the equity markets early in the day session triggered a round of
profit taking that extended into the close. Wednesday's low-range
close leaves the door open for a steady to weaker opening for
Thursday. A lower close on Thursday would signal that the initial
rebound off last week's low has likely come to an end.

March copper closed lower on Wednesday as profit taking continues
following last week's dramatic run up. March's inability to sustain a
breakout above November's high crossing at 73.70 along with a number
of short-term momentum indicators turning neutral to bearish from
overbought levels hints that a broad double top might be in place.
Wednesday's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading
on Thursday as March might try to consolidate some of this week's
losses.

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

March corn posted a new contract low on Wednesday following reports
that Malaysia bought at least one cargo of Chinese corn for April
shipment. The renewed Chinese exports combined with sluggish U.S.
exports triggered another round of fund selling amidst a lack of
buying interest. A short covering bounce ahead of the close allowed
March corn to close at long-term support crossing at 2.04 1/4. If the
decline continues, psychological support crossing at 2.00 is March's
next target later this month. Pre-report sales exports for Thursday
range from 750K to 950K metric tons, which is still well below the
pace needed to reach this year's export projection. Fears that the
USDA will be forced to lower its export projection possibly on Friday
also weighted on prices today. Unless the U.S. Dollar falls making
U.S. corn more competitive with other feed grains on the world market
and or export demand sees a significant increase in the near future,
corn prices will continue to decline until increased demand surfaces.

March wheat posted an inside day with a lower close on Wednesday due
to spill over weakness from corn and soybeans. It's the same old
story the bears continues to beat the strong U.S. Dollar has made
U.S. wheat less competitive on the world market resulting in sluggish
export demand. Today's low-range close leaves the door open for
additional weakness on Thursday if export sales prove disappointing.
December's low crossing at 2.77 marks the next level of support.
Closes below this low could lead to an eventual test of the contract
low crossing at 2.73 later this winter. Pre-report sales estimates
range from 450K to 600K metric tons. March wheat will need to close
above January's downtrend line crossing near 2.86 to temper the
near-term bearish outlook in the market.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

March soybeans closed sharply lower on Wednesday erasing most of this
week's short covering gains. Today's sell off was triggered by a lack
of fresh market friendly news, the start of harvest in Brazil and
China's unwillingness to postpone its March 20th deadline for
implementation of GMO policies regarding soybean imports. While a
short covering bounce late in the day tempered some of today's
losses, the door remains open for a likely test of last week's low in
the near future. Traders are looking for tomorrow's export sales
report to come in between 600K to 800K metric tons. While there is
some talk that the USDA might raise its export projection for this
year in Friday's report, bearish traders are quick to say that any
increase has already been factored into prices. Until March soybeans
can close above the reaction high crossing at 4.39 1/2, the February
low has not been confirmed.

March soybean meal posted a key reversal down on Wednesday as it
filled the gap crossing at 147.90 in early trading. A short covering
bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's gains leaving the
door open for sideways trading on Thursday. Pre-report export sales
estimates range from 75K to 140K metric tons. Today's near mid-range
close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday however;
trading is likely to be subdued ahead of Friday's supply/demand
report. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that sideways
to lower prices are possible during the first half of February.

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

April hogs closed lower on Wednesday pressured by steady to lower
cash bids and soft packer demand. Light markets tempered today's sell
off as April consolidated above broken resistance crossing at 61.90.
Nearby cash fundamentals continue to look sloppy with a weak tone in
pork cutout values and shrinking packer margins. Favorable weather
conditions are also a potential bearish factor. If the rally
continues, weekly resistance, crossing at 63.60 is a potential target
later this week. At the same time, both daily and weekly stochastics
are overbought hinting that a major top appears to be near. However,
closes below initial trendline support crossing near $61 are needed
before this is confirmed.

April cattle closed higher on Wednesday and above the 75% retracement
level of last year's decline crossing at 76.00. If the rally
continues, the bottom of last summer's trading range crossing at
77.10 is a target later this month. Today's rally was triggered by
higher boxed beef values. Cash bids have not be established however,
bullish traders are hoping to see $72 bids later this week.
Wednesday's high-range close leaves the door open for additional
gains on Thursday.

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

March coffee closed slightly higher on Wednesday due to light short
covering following a gap lower opening, which was triggered by origin
and fund selling. However, light trade buying after the opened
triggered a short covering bounce that lasted into the close. March
is at a crossroad and needs to close above 46.20 or below 44.00 to
clear up near-term direction in the market. Momentum indicators are
very oversold hinting that a short covering bounce might be needed
soon.

March cocoa posted an inside day with a higher close due to short
covering that left Tuesday's downside reversal unconfirmed. Closes
above January's high at 1422 would negate the possibility that a
double top is forming while opening the door for a possible test of
weekly resistance crossing at 1508 later this winter. Stochastics are
still bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible
near-term. March will need to close below last week's low crossing at
1327 to temper the bullish outlook in the market.

May sugar closed higher on Wednesday but below mid-range. Early
strength fell short of testing broken support marked by last
October's low crossing at 601. Until May can post multiple closes
above this broken support level thereby tempering the bearish outlook
in the market, the door remains open for additional weakness later
this month and a possible test of weekly support crossing at 5.48.
Momentum indicators are oversold but remain bearish signaling that
additional weakness is possible near-term.

March cotton posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close
on Wednesday as the market waits for near-term direction following
the release of Thursday's export sales report. A friendly report on
Thursday could renew March's rally off last week's low that could
lead to a test of January's high crossing at 38.50 later this month.
Barring a major surprised in tomorrow's report, upside potential
appears limited ahead of Friday's supply/demand report. Cotton will
likely remain range bound until the market gets a better handle on
this year's planted acreage.

The Dow  topped out in February of 1966 at 995. By September of that year the Dow had  tumbled to 744. The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of '67. By  March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly speculative  peak of 985 in December of '68. The Dow then sank to 631 in December of '70.  

By April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950, only to fall to 869 in  February of '72. A big rally then took the Dow (unconfirmed) to a record high of  1051 in January of '73, turning everyone bullish. But by December of '73 the Dow  had collapsed to 788. Think that was bad - by December of '74 the Dow had sunk  to a bear market low of 577. At that time, the gurus and geniuses of Wall Street  were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking openly about the end of  capitalism. Of course, that was the bottom

And that's  the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down. By  late 1974 investors were dizzy, they were desperate, they were wrung-out, they  had left Wall Street, many for  good.

Dear John Lavorato, Hunter Shively, Andy Lewis, and Chris Gaskill:

I regret to inform you that I will be resigning from the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture and will await further direction in the effort to fulfill my current obligations.  It is definitely with a bit of sadness that I have arrived at the conclusion to leave the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture, but I believe that it is in the best interest of my young career.  In addition, after signing a UBS offer letter I have realized over the last two days that given my current assignment it would be very difficult for me to continue to be motivated and to produce in the manner that would please both management and myself. Therefore I believe it is in the best interest of both parties that I leave the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture. Although this decision was not an easy one for me to make, I have decided to pursue other opportunities. 
I am extremely grateful for the opportunities I have been given here in this organization and for the investments that both you as individuals and the organization as a whole have made in my personal career development.  I believe I have worked hard at Enron and I trust that I made significant value adding contributions. It is because of my experience here and the tutelage that all of you have given me that I have my current knowledge and opportunities. I am very grateful for all of my experiences here at Enron/UBS Warburg, and I would like to personally thank all of you guys upon your return from Connecticut.  I will also make a concerted effort to maintain contact with all of you.
UBS Warburg Energy will certainly be a successful organization and I wish you all the best of luck with the exciting challenge of rebuilding this great business.
I await your direction upon receiving my intention to resign, and I offer my services in order to make the process as smooth as possible. 

Sincerely,
Denver Plachy

LazyTraders,

Here are some of the things you can do to give yourself the best
possible tools to be successful in today's Markets.

1. Internet Connection.
Make sure you get the fastest Internet Connection possible.
Get a Cable Modem or DSL for $49 per month.

If you do not have $2500 you can open an account for as low as $500

with :
http://www.datek.com but be prepared that your execution times can be slower.
You can open an account with them from anywhere in the world, EXCEPT from Canada.

3. Wear Blinders when trading.
Do not subscribe to 10 different quote and news services because it will distract you.
Use one or two Quote and News services, Real-time of course and stick with them.

4. Do not trade on negative days when you are a beginner.
There is still money to be made on negative days but it is easier to ride a positive wave.

5. Find a Trading System that works.
Don't start trading without any kind of System because your emotions will get you.

6. You can now trade from 7.45 AM EST until 8 PM EST and before

*840% profit is the maximum you could have made in the last 10 weeks if you
would have bought Michael's Stockpicks when he called them and you would have
sold at the high for the day. To be able to sell at the high for the day
consistently is not realistic.
The risk factor is high in stock trading and  only "Risk Capital" or
"Risk
Funds" should be used in such trading. A person who does not have extra
Risk
Capital, or Risk Funds, that they can afford to lose, should not trade in the
market. No "SAFE" trading system has ever been devised, and no one
including us
can guarantee profits or freedom from loss. We are not brokers or stock
advisors.

COMMENT: Many economists are surprised by the strength in retail and housing
sales. Apparently, they don't have kids. As the father of five, I know that
we Baby Boomers will be spending lots of money on our Baby Boomlet for quite
some time even if we've lost some of our job security and some of our stock
market wealth. Today, there are roughly 76 million Baby Boomers, who were
born between 1946 and 1964. They are 37-55 years old. They've been busy with
their careers, but not too busy to have some sex along the way: They've had
an estimated 75 million kids--currently aged 0 to 25 years old-- since 1976.
These kids cost lots of money to house, clothe, feed, transport, entertain,
and educate.

In poor agrarian societies having kids is often an economic necessity to
provide extra labor to tend the livestock  and bring in the crops. In modern
industrial societies having kids is a sign of optimism about the future. The
birth rate is currently relatively high in the US and low in Japan. Rapid
population growth in modern economies often is associated with rapid
economic growth. The Census 2000 counted 281.4 million people in the United
States, a 13.2% increase from 1990. The population growth of 32.7 million
persons represents the largest census-to-census increase in American
history. The previous record increase was 28.0 million people (an 18.4%
increase) between 1950 and 1960.

Both the 1950s and 1990s were decades of prosperity. Let's keep the
prosperity going: Have kids! I am doing my part for the good of the country:
Laura Juliette joined the Yardeni Bunch on Friday, May 11. Fortunately, the
beautiful baby girl looks just like her beautiful Mom.

SUBSCRIBERS: As the new kid on the bloc--i.e., the new investment strategist
on Wall Street--I've been working hard to develop my models for analyzing
earnings, valuation, and performance. Of course, the tools of the trade also
include stocks-versus-bonds asset allocation models as well as equity sector
allocation models. I think my tool kit is fairly complete. However, my
strong suit in my previous life as an economist was focusing on long-term
trends that have important investment implications. I intend to build on
this foundation by identifying investment themes for long-term investors and
selecting companies that are likely to be major beneficiaries. I plan to
track the performance of these themes. This is a work in progress. I begin
with the following five themes: 1) Power Play, 2) China Challenge, 3) TMT2,
4) The Brady Bunch, and 5) Jurassic Park. I pick stocks in my latest GLOBAL
PORTFOLIO STRATEGY. In Monday's WEEKLY AUDIO FORUM, we'll discuss whether
the profits slump is ending or spreading. In addition, my special guest will
explore the outlook for biotech.

PUBLIC: The latest EARNINGS WEEK covers the retailers, a sector that I favor
and has performed relatively well so far this year. The May GLOBAL
STRATEGIST'S HANDBOOK is posted on the HOME page. So are the latest ANALYST'
S HANDBOOKs covering Consumer Spending, High-Tech, Energy, and Basic
Materials. The KEY WEEKLY INDICATORS and the FED WATCHER have been expanded.

BUBBLE II? (May Global Column printed in 11 leading financial publications
around the world): I recently reread a wonderfully written book titled
"Manias, Panics, and Crashes," by the great economist and financial
historian, Charles P. Kindleberger. It is a history of financial crises.
Professor Kindleberger, who taught at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, also presents a thoughtful analysis of why they occur. Finally,
he offers valuable advice to central bankers on how to avoid such crises and
how to deal with them if they do occur.

The book was written in 1978, but remains remarkably relevant today. Indeed,
new editions were printed in 1989 and 1996. I am sure that Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan has read it. Perhaps he should read it again if he wants to avoid
another bubble in the stock market. The recent dramatic rebound in U.S.
stock prices in response to stimulative monetary policy is a hopeful sign
for the rapidly deteriorating economy. However, the rally already shows
signs of renewed "irrational exuberance," especially once again among
technology stocks. Reflating the tech-heavy Nasdaq bubble would be good news
for some investors in the short run, but a Bubble II scenario could be bad
news for the long-term health of the global economy.

Professor Kindleberger convincingly argues that speculative bubbles are
mostly monetary phenomena. They occur because money is too easily available.
The bubbles burst when the easy money stops. How should central banks manage
the resulting crises? Kindleberger warns, "the lender of last resort should
exist, but his presence should be doubted." Furthermore, he advises that the
central bank should always come to the rescue to halt deflation, "but always
leave it uncertain whether rescue will arrive in time or at all so as to
instill caution in other speculators.."

Currently there is no uncertainty about the Fed's goal. The message to
investors is clear: The folks at the Fed don't want a recession. On April
18, the Fed lowered the federal funds rate by half a point, the fourth cut
this year. Now there are 450 basis points left between the federal funds
rate and zero. (The U.S. monetary policymakers are expected to lower rates
again by half a point when they meet on May 15.) Since the start of the
year--in less than four months--the Fed folks have reduced the rate by 200
basis points, while the jobless rate has remained close to 4%. According to
the April 18 official easing statement, they acted in response to a recent
set of developments that "threatens to keep the pace of economic activity
unacceptably weak."

This wording suggests that they must be aiming for economic growth that is
acceptably strong. Apparently, they are very concerned that the profits
recession is on the verge of turning into an economy-wide recession. Nearly
every company reporting disappointing profits so far this year also
announced plans to cut employment. Obviously, if many companies do so,
consumer spending would be depressed and profits would continue to fall
during the second half of the year.

The Fed folks strongly implied in their April 18 statement that they now
want stock prices to rise to offset "the possible [negative] effects of
earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption." This is a dramatic
reversal from early last year, when the Fed Chairman said that the stock
market rally was causing a wealth effect that was stimulating excess demand.
This explicit statement violates Professor Kindleberger's advice to keep
speculators guessing.

What should investors do? Bond investors have already decided that a
pro-growth Fed is not in their best interest. This explains why bond yields
have not declined along with short-term interest rates so far this year.
Indeed, yields have been mostly moving higher. Obviously, bond investors
believe that the Fed will succeed in reviving economic growth, and maybe
even lift inflation. Monetarists observe that the money supply, as measure
by M2, is up at an annualized 11% over the past 13 weeks.

An ascending yield curve--with bond yields above money-market interest
rate--and rapidly growing M2 are both bullish for the economy and therefore
for stocks. The problem is that stocks are not cheap. In early May, the
price-to-earnings ratio (based on 12-month forward consensus expected
earnings) was back up to 22, from a low of 19 earlier this year. It hit a
record high of 25 at the end of 1999, just a few months before the bubble
burst. Back then, the Fed had provided easy money to cushion anticipated Y2K
problems that never happened. Now, the Fed is providing easy money to
minimize the pain resulting from the bursting of Bubble I, which seems to be
setting the stage for Bubble II.

I like bubbles. You can make lots of money very quickly when a bubble is
inflating, as long as you get out just before it bursts. I am amazed,
though, that so many investors remain so obsessed with technology stocks,
despite the fact that so much money was lost in these stocks over the past
year. Many tech stocks rebounded 30%, 40%, 50% or more during April. Of
course, many tech stocks are up from $10 to $15 after plunging from highs of
$100 or more early last year. Nevertheless, the bulls charged in recently
snorting that the worst is over.

They are probably right, but many tech price-to-earnings ratios are back
over 30 suggesting that the good old days of 30%-plus earnings growth will
soon be back. I doubt that. I also doubt that technology deserves a
valuation multiple well above the overall market's multiple, especially
after the tech wreck of the past year. Nevertheless, if you must play tech,
then do so with software companies that are not as vulnerable as are tech
hardware companies to inventory problems and competitive pressures on profit
margins.

Professor Kindleberger concludes his book by asking whether we even need a
lender of last resort. Some monetarists and other critics of central banking
practices observe that the monetary authorities usually cause the financial
crisis by providing easy money for too long. Perhaps, it is time for the Fed
Chairman to declare that the Fed has eased enough as evidenced by the
ascending yield curve and the rapid growth in M2. It has done enough to
revive economic growth in the long run, although there might be some more
pain in the short run. Then we could remain rationally exuberant about the
long-term prospects for stocks.

June 8, 2001 - Juniper Networks spoiled Intel's party on Friday, as the
router maker upstaged Intel's positive earnings preannouncement with an
earnings warning.

Traders were also unnerved by a software glitch that caused the New York
Stock Exchange to shut down for more than an hour in the morning.

The ISDEX http://www.wsrn.com/apps/ISDEX/ lost 9 to 259, and the Nasdaq
dropped 48 to 2215. The S&P 500 declined 12 to 1264, and the Dow fell 113
to 10,977. Volume fell to 859 million shares on the NYSE, and 1.42 billion
on the Nasdaq, but the decline was largely due to the NYSE shutdown.
Decliners led 17 to 13 on the NYSE, and 21 to 15 on the Nasdaq. For
earnings reports, visit our earnings calendar at
http://www.wsrn.com/apps/earnings/internet.xpl and reported earnings at
http://www.wsrn.com/apps/earnings/ireported.xpl. For after hours quotes
and news, visit our after hours trading site at
http://www.afterhourstrading.com.

Juniper (NASDAQ:JNPR) plunged 8.47 to 38.16 after announcing that earnings
will be 8-9 cents a share, well under 24-cent estimates. The company also
declined to provide guidance beyond the June quarter. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)
fell 1.25 to 20.57, Avici (NASDAQ:AVCI) lost .90 to 9.42, Ciena
(NASDAQ:CIEN) dropped 5.60 to 56.24, and Tellabs (NASDAQ:TLAB) fell to a
new 52-week low of 30.92.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) slipped .47 to 30.67 after saying revenues will be
"slightly below the midpoint" of the range it provided on April 17.
Traders took the reaffirmation as good news initially, but then the stock
lost ground after the Juniper warning. Handspring (NASDAQ:HAND), off .90
to 8, issued an earnings warning.

i2 (NASDAQ:ITWO) added .85 to 24.09 on rumors of contract wins.

Verity (NASDAQ:VRTY) surged 4.04 to 23.35 on a positive earnings
preannouncement.

Openwave (NASDAQ:OPWV) fell 2.15 to 40.15 after Chairman Alain Rossmann,
the "Father of WAP," resigned to security start-up Secret Seal.

NetZero (NASDAQ:NZRO) and Juno (NASDAQ:JWEB) announced they will merge,
forming a new company called United Online. Both companies will become
wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Liberate (NASDAQ:LBRT) surged 1.55 to 9.53 on a Wall Street Journal report
that the company plans to scale back its interactive TV service in favor
of a less complex version, which could help the company with AT&T.

Some technical comments on the market: Note: We include charts in the
technical market commentary. If you can't get the charts via the e-mail
newsletter version, try this link:
http://www.afterhourstrading.com/column.html

The Dow (first chart), the S&P 500 (second chart), and the S&P 100 (third
chart) all broke their most recent uptrends today (the lower black
trendlines), and also kept the potential head-and-shoulder tops intact.
Those potential tops make 1250 on the S&P 500 and 642 on the S&P 100
critical support. The Nasdaq (fourth chart) and Nasdaq 100 (fifth chart)
are forming similar topping patterns, making the 2100-2175 range on the
Nasdaq and 1760-1850 on the Nasdaq 100 important support. Finally, also on
the Nasdaq (sixth chart), notice how MACD and PPO, two very good trend
indicators over the last year, are giving sell signals but are trying to
turn up (the arrows). Also note the declining volume since the May 22 top.
That could support the formation of a right shoulder on a head and
shoulders top, or it could just make the whole move since then a bull
market correction, with perhaps one more downleg coming. When that
downtrend line on the volume indicator breaks, the next big move should
come. Next week is options expiration, typically an up week, but the
following week could potentially mark the beginning of a strong move down.

Here you go, sorry to take so long but we had a couple of things here to deal with.  I went back to 1/1/2000, which gives you 15 months (through the end of last month).  Note that CAISO are actuals, all else are forecasts.  Let me know if you have any questions.

its business is awful, but not disastrous. Investors

Intel, which rose $1.32 to $31.14 ahead of the midquarter
conference call, rose another dollar or so, in after-hours
trading.

*** As Hank Herrmann, chief financial officer at Waddell &
Reed Financial Services, tells smartmoney.com, "The market
is putting its hands over its eyes and saying 'It looks

*** Bill Fleckenstein offers a similarly skeptical reaction

retail companies with PC exposure gave a first-hand view of
souring conditions. Circuit City (CC) released its same-
store sales, which were down 25% year-over-year, led by
poor PC sales. And Ingram Micro (IM) announced layoffs. It
is no secret that demand stinks and PC inventories are up.
There is not one single shred of evidence that anything is
getting better for Intel."

*** Nor for anyone else. Yesterday's employment data, for
example, showed initial jobless claims rose yet again to
432,000 for the week ended June 2nd - the worst number since
Sept. '92. Continuing claims for unemployment benefits
spiked more than 7% in a single week.

*** A few of the newly unemployed came from Wall Street's
ranks. So far this year, Wall Street firms have announced
plans to eliminate more than 10,000 jobs.

*** Given J.P. Morgan's dire earnings forecast two days
ago, it is certainly not the only Wall Street firm that
might be going on a "Slimfast" diet.

*** Says Goldman Sachs chief executive, Henry Paulson, "We
are clearly in a down cycle, and I think you'll get worse
before it gets better." Already, Goldman Sachs has
announced plans to reduce its work force by 12%.

*** The slowdown affects numerous dependent industries of
all sizes. At Patroon's restaurant, a popular midtown
Manhattan venue for "deal-closing" dinners, owner Ken
Aretsky misses the dot.com bubble. "The days when $1,000
bottles of wine flowed like water are gone," he tells
Bloomberg News.

*** Still, the average fund manager made $436,000 last
year, up from $322,500 in '99. The average fund investor,
by contrast, lost 17%.

*** The days of Manhattan office rents soaring ever higher
are also gone. Yesterday, a commercial real estate broker
e-mailed a brochure to me advertising office space from a
"motivated sublessor" at nearby 14 Wall Street. (This
building is directly across Broad Street from the Grant's
Investor offices at 30 Wall). It turns out that the
motivated sublessor is none other than the struggling
financial website, thestreet.com.

*** The revenue-starved enterprise is offering the entire
14th floor - 34,719 square feet - on a five-year sublet for
about $30 per foot. All told that would be more than $1
million per year - money that the Street.com would rather
not have to pay. Were somebody's eyes bigger than their e-
stomach?

*** US hotel room revenues are experiencing their largest
decline in a decade. Likewise, airline revenues are
experiencing extreme turbulence.

*** May was a particularly cruel month for the commercial
carriers, to judge from Continental's harrowing 10% revenue
decline last month. According to the Air Transport
Association, domestic airline revenues have been in a
tailspin since January.

*** Move over N.I.M.B.Y.s! Make way for Russian
"I.M.B.Y.s." NIMBY a popular acronym for "not-in-my-back-
yard," refers to folks who prefer not to live near
industrial facilities like nuclear power plants and the
like. But Russia's parliament, the Duma, has adopted a more
pragmatic and, yes, capitalistic philosophy. (See, they're
learning!) The Duma approved a bitterly contested plan in
which Russia may earn about $20 billion over ten years by
importing and processing spent nuclear fuel.

*** While Lady Liberty tells the world, "Give me your
tired, your poor, your huddled masses," Mother Russia says,
"Bring me your highly toxic, your glowing, your radioactive
waste masses."

And more notes...from Bill back in Paris

*** "Almost every statistic that involves consumer health
is horrible and getting worse," write Chad Hudson of the
Prudentbear.com. Consumers continue to spend money they
don't have, while their incomes go down and their costs of
living go up.

*** Brian Nottage, with Economy.com, argues that the
consumer is facing a second major crisis. After the blow-up
of the dot.com bubble comes the explosion of the "lifestyle
bubble" in which consumers have been living for the last
few years.

*** But when the lifestyle bubble pops, corporate earnings
and stock prices must fall. Consumers must reduce
spending...pay down debt...and build savings. While there
is no sure way of knowing when this will happen...or even
if it will happen....it leaves stock market investors in a
dangerously exposed position. "High risk, no return...no
thanks," concludes Peter Bernstein.

*** What's the alternative? How about Morocco, Egypt,
Jordan and other Middle Eastern markets? "There is a very
low correlation between the Middle East and the rest of the
world," says a broker quoted in Forbes. How about CIB, an
international bank in Egypt? "It's like being able to buy
J.P. Morgan Chase with an 11% dividend yield and a P/E of 5
times 20001 earnings." Or, Eastern Tobacco, another
Egyptian company, it can be yours for only 4 times
earnings.

*** Meanwhile, in the Western Hemisphere..."Haiti is an
embarassment." wrote my friend Doug Casey on a recent trip
there. "Although, the quality of the cuisine is at least as
good as that in France, dining out at the few restaurants
that are still open is about all that passes for
entertainment these days; the lack of tourists and
abundance of crime combine to severely limit possibilities.
So does the fact electricity is predictably out at least
several hours every day; every home and business must have
its own generator. And crime really is a problem." (see:
Zombies Workers and The Fight For Survival
http;//ww.dailyreckoning.com/body_headline.cfm?id=1206)

*** Tony Blair, of course, won yesterday's vote in Britain.
"I just forgot to vote," said a friend in London, "the
whole thing just didn't seem to make any difference." And
this from my friend, Martin Spring: "Britain's election
campaign is so boring that watching paint dry is more
exciting. That's not a throwaway line - investigators
actually compared the pulse rate and blood pressure of a
test group watching vinyl emulsion drying on a wall and
vote-chasing politicians, and got higher readings for the
paint."

GOD, MAN, AND ALAN GREENSPAN

"Tell me why do fools fall in love..."
fragment of popular song from the late '50s

Why must stocks fall in price?

I pose the question again today, dear reader, because I
know it interests you, as it does me. If stocks do not have
to fall in price, we could buy the big names of the S&P -
even at 28 times earnings. Maybe they would rise
higher...and stay higher...forever.

Stock prices rise from time to time - as if on an
irregular, unpredictable ocean tide. Waves of bullishness
rise up...between troughs of despair...and crash into the
rocky shoreline. No matter how high the waves, nor how low
the tide might ebb, sooner or later, as Jeremy Grantham
reminds us - stock prices regress to sea level.
The memory of man runneth not to the contrary.

Theory confirms experience, in this case as in others.
After all, Why should investors be willing to pay more for
a dollar of earnings this year than they were 5 years ago?
Why would they settle for a return of 5% on one investment
when they could get 10% on another?

Stocks are nothing more than partial ownership of
businesses. People rarely buy businesses for fun. They buy
them for the income they will produce and let the price of
shares rise and fall along with business earnings.

Over time, share prices tend to rise...but only in line
with increased and accumulated earnings. If there were no
competition and no alternatives, businesses might increase
profit margins year after year. But that would be a
different world than the one we live in. Without
alternatives, there would be no stock market and no
decisions for an investor to make.

As it is, competition holds profits down and directs
investors' money so as force all investment profits down to
the same sea level of returns, adjusted for risk and other
variables.

Over time, an article in this month's Fortune tells us,
companies' earnings grow alongside GDP, inflation, and
stock prices. Investors should expect only about 6% per
year...plus dividends of, currently, only 1.2%.

But during a 17-year bull market, stock market returns rose
far above the mean. A drop back to sea level requires
either a long period of low or zero returns...as long as 10
to 15 years. Or, stocks could fall sharply - with the S&P
down about 60% estimates Fortune, reducing P/Es from 28 to
about 10 - and then resume its normal rate of return.

But, look carefully. For there, standing on the beach, an
aged, care-worn little man holds out a staff. It is King
Alan Greenspan Canute, bidding the waters to hold fast.
'Stay where you are,' he commands. "Resist the tug of the
business cycle, ignore the tilt of the credit cycle, and
ignore the lunatic phases of investor sentiment...that
inconstant moon of irrational exuberance and unreasonable
gloom...."

"It takes faith to believe in the invisible hand," said
Mark Skousen at last week's lecture in Paris. "You can't
see it. And yet, we know it works."

Everyone has faith in something, dear reader. Some have
faith in Adam Smith's 'invisible hand" of God. Others have
faith in Mr. Greenspan's wrinkled mitts.

Some people believe they can think their way to the truth.
Others wait for it to be revealed to them. But one way or
another, we arrive at a truth we find convenient and hold
to it...until the real thing finally falls upon us.

Your correspondent...
Waiting for the truth to fall upon him

P.S. "Did you miss us?" asked Maria, upon our return from
London.

"Well, it just wasn't the same without you," came her
mother's careful reply.

Dear Alumni,
    My name is Nicholas Jamroz, and  I am pledging good ol' Mass Delta of SAE.  While  getting a sig with the current treasurer Matt Barrett, he assigned me to a  mission.  In order to complete this sig, I need to find out which former  treasurer left a particular item on the wall as he was leaving office.  I  chose a stuffed bear.  It looks pretty mangled, with stuffing busting out  at the seams, and a torn-off nose.  It is brownish-gray in color.  Any  help you could give me as to who left this or any story behind the bear, please  e-mail me back at njamroz@wpi.edu .   Thank you for your help and keep the SAE tradition  alive.

THE WEEK/Too Much of a Good Thing?

The specter of  "overinvestment" is haunting Wall Street like a bad
hangover on the morning after. A recent Business Week special report
entitled "Telecom Meltdown" describes the likely ripple effects--none of
them good--from too much capital chasing too few opportunities. A Barron's
piece on analyst Susan Kalla, the "Dr. Doom" of telecommunications, warns
investors away from the industry because of "too much capacity and
collapsing prices." And then there's any number of financial-page feature
articles, in newspapers running the gamut from the Sunday New York Times
to USA Today, with headlines borrowed from the obituary section.

The telecom overinvestment thesis implies that the capital markets badly
misjudged the size of the opportunity, and supplied crazed technologists
(we're being charitable) with too much money. The underlying premise is
that growth in demand for telecom services, which is driven by the growth
in network data traffic, will be much smaller than the companies, their
financiers, and their investors had originally anticipated. Kalla, for
example, expects annual growth in data traffic of 50% to 70% over the next
few years; industry bulls--us decidedly among them--see traffic doubling
every three to four months.

The bears' projections are based on historic growth rates--the
pre-Internet, pre-optical world. But the pace of technological change has
been staggering, both costs and prices are dropping precipitously, and
extrapolations based on previously-experienced patterns of demand will
prove well off the mark. As more and more enterprises adopt Internet-based
technologies that significantly lower the cost of moving data, the growth
in network traffic--and the demand for supporting services--will, as Epoch
Partners puts it, "spur previously undetectable demand //and// unleash
massive amounts of data."

On Wall Street, though, the pessimists are winning. Spurred on by the
well-publicized failures of Northpoint and Winstar, two
widely--followed-and hugely leveraged--new-era telecom providers,
investors have fled the whole new telecom sector. Prices stocks and bonds
alike are stuck in distressed territory.

Consider that an opportunity. Because at crunch times like now, market
dynamics cause the good to be lumped indiscriminately with the bad and the
ugly. When bond and stock mutual funds are hit with panic-mode
redemptions---as they have been for much of the past year or so--portfolio
managers don't have the luxury of drawing fine distinctions between, say,
flawed-business-plan CLECs on the one hand, and aggressive, well-managed
next generation IP carriers--say, Global Crossing--on the other. They sell
what they can, and prices fall across an entire sector. That's when
opportunity knocks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FROM THE DIGITAL POWER REPORT/The New New Chip
"Despite forty-plus years of post-transistor history, new semiconductors
and new applications for quantum technologies are often greeted with deep
skepticism by engineers and companies rooted in more traditional materials
and devices. There were gallium arsenide skeptics in the 1980s too-the
material seemed exotic, difficult, and daring, and it was. But today GaAs
is ubiquitous. In the early stages, every new semiconductor always seems
too difficult to work with, impossible to grow into defect-free crystals,
just not worth all the trouble. Then it's not quite impossible, but too
expensive. And then it gets cheap."
Peter Huber and Mark Mills see a new wave rising in May's Digital Power
Report, available online Friday. Subscribers log in at

IN THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR/Microstuck

"Judge Judy, please don't break up Microsoft. We have them just where we
want them, stuck in a corner with wet paint drying around them. Clinton's
antitrust pinstripes may have sought their place in history by making
history of Microsoft. But strange as this may sound, an intact Microsoft
may well have done more than venture capital to create a continuum of
value in the technology world.

"I have never cashed a check from Microsoft, never owned the stock, could
care less if they like me or hate me. I do believe that the way they have
structured the PC and software market, rather than stifling innovation,
stimulates it. I also believe that a divided Microsoft is a dangerous,
hungry beast, while an intact Microsoft is stuck in a position where it
can do little harm and significant good."

Andy Kessler, our favorite California money manager, argues "Don't Break
Up Microstuck"  in May's American Spectator. Read the full text at

STOREWIDTH 2001/No Bandwidth Bottleneck!
In response to technical troubles with the Webcast of Storewidth 2001, the
networking geeks at iBEAM have been working overtime. As a result,
original morning and afternoon segments have now been re-edited by
individual speech and panel, meaning smaller, more manageable files. In
addition, the 56k version has been adjusted to run more smoothly over AOL
dial-ups. Unfortunately, Mac users are out of luck; we've made the notice
on the registration page more emphatic to head off any further confusion.
For other problems, please call iBEAM tech support directly, at
800-773-3371.
Now the really good news: the Storewidth 2001 Webcast has been extended
through May. Passwords for unlimited viewing are available at $50 each, at
800-261-5307.

FRIDAY LETTER BONUS/Neal Stephenson on Code

"A person who went into a coma before Microsoft was founded, and woke up
now, could pick up this morning's New York Times and understand everything
in it--almost:

"Item: the richest man in the world made his fortune from-what? Railways?
Shipping? Oil? No, operating systems. Item: the Department of Justice is
tackling Microsoft's supposed OS monopoly with legal tools that were
invented to restrain the power of Nineteenth-Century robber barons. Item:
a woman friend of mine recently told me that she'd broken off a (hitherto)
stimulating exchange of e-mail with a young man. At first he had seemed
like such an intelligent and interesting guy, she said, but then "he
started going all PC-versus-Mac on me."

"What the hell is going on here? And does the operating system business
have a future, or only a past?"

>From "In the Beginning was the Command Line" by Neal Stephenson, whose
epic Telecosmic novels include "Snowcrash" and "Cryptomnicon." Read the
his essay on software at http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html

LETTERS TO THE FRIDAY LETTER

To The Editors:

Blaming the Fed for the recent revaluation of our markets is not overly
insightful. Too much capital was chasing too few investment opportunities,
supply and demand-Economics 101 remember? The Fed's actions allowed us to
descend in reasonably orderly fashion (it didn't happen in 21 days),
giving markets time to adjust, adapt and survive a monster that could have
destroyed our capital markets. Blaming the Fed for deflating the market is
as ludicrous as blaming people like George for inflating it. There was a
lot more to it.

Bruce R Lindahl


To the Editors:

Thank you for the true "bonus" of Ray Kurzweil's pr?cis. My first response
was awe at the disruptive paradigms shaping our future. But I also
realized that such explosive change disrupts predictability in general,
and thus the continued dominance of any one company. For someone holding
Telecosm stars such as JDSU, Kurzweil's piece is frightening.

My question: is there a way to involve subscribers such as me, so that we
all can all profit? Kurzweil's introduction states, "You will get $40
trillion just by reading this." I believe in that promise, but I cannot
see the opportunity! A Gilder mutual fund? A venture capital operation
comfortable for small investors? Otherwise, I benefit intellectually, but
the frustration is strong.

Harry Taylor

(Eds: We've certainly thought about it, but there's a built-in conflict
between independently analyzing companies-our stock in trade--and
directing investments. Look no further than the big Wall Street brokerage
houses. There are, however, a number of high-quality independent brokers
who offer Gilder-oriented advice. Our subscriber-services staff will be
happy to refer you to them.)

Morning Watch List
This section contains 6 stocks that are expected move in 1 to 5 days. 
Click here for this morning's Watch List Stocks: http://www.realtimetraders.com/marketinfo/watchlist.asp Beyond The Numbers
Extreme optimism drove tech stocks higher
Thursday tech stocks and the market as a whole started to rally on favorable 
news from the semiconductor sector. First the Semiconductor Industry 
association said the future demand for semiconductors would be strong 
despite the drop in the book-to-bill ratio. Following that announcement 
National Semiconductor said it is starting to see improvements as some of its 
major customers are starting to place orders again. This news combined with 
Monday's positive comments from Xilinx Inc. (XLNX) propelled the 
semiconductor sector higher. Another factor that helped the index move higher 
was the anticipation of more favorable comments from industry leader Intel 
Corporation (INTC) after the close. Intel finished the regular session higher 
by $1.32 to close at $31.14. 
Just as traders expected after the close Intel said it expects to meet earnings 
estimates. While they were not really positive comments, investors were happy 
to hear the company was not warning. As a result traders drove the stock even 
higher in the after-hours session. Shares of Intel traded as high as $32.85 on 1 
million shares in the Island ECN. Despite the fact Intel did not warn, Merrill Lynch 
is cautious on the stock. Taking a closer look at today's comments,  
RealTimeTraders analysts are not very positive on the stock as well. It seems 
Intel really painted a mixed picture as the company said it expects revenue to be 
slightly below the midpoint of the previous guidance range given on April 17th. 
The company went on to say it sees stability in the microprocessor business 
and weakness in its communications related businesses. Readers may want to 
watch the analyst comments and rating/estimate changes on Friday. 
When Thursday's session came to a close, the semiconductor index had risen 
7.7% and closed above the 200 day moving average for the first time in more 
than 7months. While it was a broad based rally, some of the veteran traders 
expressed concern over the fact stocks such as Broadcom Corporation climbed 
$4.67 after warning that its earnings will fall short of expectations. It is also worth 
mentioning the company is expecting sales to drop by a whopping 35% below its 
first quarter number. It seems as though investors and traders have decided to 
selectively focus only on the positive news, and ignore all the negatives.
On the economic front, the government reported jobless claims rose to a 
multi-year high. Analysts had expected the number to come in around 417K, 
but the actual number was 432K. Not only did this number beat the estimates, 
but it also beat the previous week's 419K number by a wide margin. 
RealTimeTraders analysts believe this could cause some problem for the 
ailing economy. 
In our opinion, the slowing economy combined with increasing unemployment 
spells trouble for the economy. While we believe the rebate from the tax cut is 
a good thing for the economy, in our view it alone may not be enough to help 
the economy recover. It is also our opinion the longer the slowdown lasts, the 
harder it will be to recover. Under the current circumstances we believe the 
Federal Reserve may consider another rate cut to boost the economy at the 
next FOMC meeting on June 26th and 27th. Ahead of the meeting markets and 
analysts will be watching the economic reports closely for any clues to determine 
if the recent rate cuts have started to help the economy. 
We at RealTimeTraders continue to believe earnings will be the driving force 
in the near-term. In our opinion the companies that manage to deliver strong 
earnings in this difficult environment will emerge as the leaders when the 
economy and markets starts to improve. 
Sector Analysis
Retailers are experiencing a significant slowdown
Thursday the markets received retail sales figures for the month of May. 
Most of the retailers reported significant declines in same store sales, which 
surprised investors and analysts alike. Many analysts had argued the rising 
consumer confidence and lower interest rates should improve sales for the 
retailers. Thursday morning the retail sector gapped down, but regained all 
its losses and closed higher by 1.2%. Which once again illustrates that traders 
and investors are too optimistic and are ignoring the facts. Some of the 
companies that announced negative results in this sector include The Limited 
Inc. (LTD), Gap Inc. (GPS), Federated Dept Stores (FD) and American Eagle 
Outfitters (AEOS).

We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:

 

1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today's Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order. 

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area and select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each set of "zeros" for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

Hey guys.  There is a new Alumni search database that was added to the Mass
Delta homepage.  It'll take 5 minutes to enter your info so anyone
from the chapter can search for anyone else.  Please take the time to enter
your info.  It asks for some historical info to log in-if you can't
remember
and have to ask, don't bother showing up at Car Rallye because you will be
bowled.

THE WEEK/Let The Bells Have It

"The lack of cheap, always-on, last-mile broadband connections to small
offices and homes is a short leash around the U.S. economy's neck. Yes,
taxes are too high, especially those on capital formation. We hope
Congress will figure out what every businessman knows: This recession is
investment-led. And yes, the Fed should drop its funds rate to 3%. And
yes, there is huge inventory overhang everywhere you look in IT. If all
that isn't enough to give you a bad hair day, ponder the telco debt bomb
that threatens to blow up Wall Street.

"The dot-com boom started in 1995 and went bust in 2000. Every dolt
imagined he was a venture investor. There was overfunding galore, idiot
businesses up the gazoo--and then pfft. Net Boom, Act II awaits. It will
occur when a catalyst technology changes everything, just as the 386 chip
and graphics transformed PCs. What the Net awaits is obvious: cheap
broadband (enough for streaming video) and always-on connections.

"Already I can hear skeptics howling that bandwidth demand is not a sure
thing, that the dogs will never eat it. But who can forecast demand
without the supply that fires the imagination and stirs entrepreneurs to
create radically new uses, not just extensions? Who in 1984 ever guessed
that most CEOs would use e-mail by 1998? Who in 1989 imagined the
necessity of Web-based supply-side chains, let alone the Web? How accurate
is it ever to gauge, say, traffic for a proposed bridge by counting ferry
boats and swimmers? Forget last-mile as you know it today: clunky DSL or
cable modem service. These are mere swimmers and ferry boats. The bridge
will come when last-mile connections are easy to order (one phone call or
Web click); quick to deliver (the very next day); always on (like
electricity in, uh, 49 states); and cheap ($20 a month or less). When the
dogs are served that, they'll eat till they burst."

Nobody makes the bandwidth case better than our great friend and tireless
Silicon Valley watcher Rich Karlgaard. Read the full text of "Let The
Bells Have It" at
http://www.forbes.com/columnists/forbes/2001/0611/051.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BIOTECH WATCH: Old Stem Cells Do It Better

"All systems were go for federally funded embryo stem-cell research at the
National Institutes of Health. New guidelines bequeathed by the Clinton
administration for skirting a congressional ban were in place. A meeting
to review the first applications for grants was set for mid-April, when
NIH's acting director Ruth Kirschstein suddenly received the word from on
high: cancel the meeting. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G.
Thompson wanted a chance to review the new guidelines. Some NIH
researchers were aghast.

"What's all the fuss about? Stem cells represent a mother lode of possible
new treatments for diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and
more. Capable of differentiating into the full spectrum of other cell
types--from a new liver cell to a new neuron--they could be ideal for
repairing or replacing diseased organs. The furor is not over their
usefulness, but their source: Should researchers use aborted or discarded
human embryos? Or should they be restricted to adult stem-cells, found in
fat, bone, and the brain?

"Those ethical questions are riveting, but they are being trumped by the
market, specifically the venture investment market, which is voting with
its dollars for adult stem-cell research. The universe of established
companies doing stem-cell research encompasses about 30 public and private
biotechnology firms. Of these, fewer than half are involved primarily in
developing treatments from stem cells. And only two of those 15 pure-play
companies do significant work with embryonic cells."

Dr Scott Gottlieb, Gilder's newest analyst, dives into the stem-cell
debate in June's issue of The American Spectator. Read the full text at
www.gilder.com.

FRIDAY BONUS/Gelernter Live

Venerable Peter Drucker argues that the greatest profits go to whoever
supplies the key missing element in a technology, igniting new spirals of
advance. Think Windows or CDMA and you have the idea.

With an elegant software application called Scopeware, Yale's prodigal
David Gelernter could hold a similar key to unlocking the pent-up power
stemming from the intersection of big bandwidth and data storage--what we
call the storewidth paradigm. At our Storewidth 2001 conference in Laguna
Niguel in April, edited excerpts from a videotaped interview we did with
Gelernter in New Haven earlier this year riveted the house. Now we're
making the full two-hour conversation available for the first time. Tune
in now, at www.gilder.com.

**********************************************************

1.	Introduction

Highlighted in this week's Big Chart update are the
surprising performance of Home/Furniture {.HFU} and the not
so surprising performance of Drugs/Biotechnology {.DBI}.
Rankings for both groups have been rising, albeit for
different reasons.  On the downside, the plummeting rank in
Financial/Consumer Loan {.FCL} is discussed.

Industry Group Analysis is just another of the many great
reasons to be a subscriber to the WallStreetCity website.

2.	Groups That Are Heating Up

Furniture stocks have been performing very well over the past
several weeks, evidenced by the four-week rise in
Home/Furniture {.HFU}.  Attracting investors to the group has
been strength in the upholstered segment as consumers are
opting for new chairs and sofas, which has helped sales at
Furniture Brands {FBN} and La-Z-Boy {LZB}.  Hardly anybody's
first guess as a industry segment that would fair well during
an economic contraction, the surprisingly strong performance
of upholstered furniture is reflective of three trends:
lifestyle changes oriented towards updating home interiors on
a regular basis, a cheaper price than full room sets or wood
furniture, and an inclination to stay home and watch
television.

Not so surprising has been the performance of
Drugs/Biotechnology {.DBI}, which has risen in rank for four
consecutive weeks.  Anthrax bioterrorism has boosted the
stocks of several small companies, while earnings, drug
research news events, and a higher tolerance for premium
valuations have caused buying pressure in many of the stocks
with larger market capitalizations.  How sustainable this
momentum is, however, may be tied to overall performance of
the Nasdaq and its ability to stay above its 50-day moving
average.  Among those stocks that have been trending upward
are Corr Therapeutics {CORR}, Transkaryotic {TKTX}, Aviron
{AVIR}, and Millennium Pharmaceuticals {MLNM}.

Other groups with rising rankings include Chemicals {.CHE},
Computer/Computer Services {.DSE}, Drugs/Research {.DRE},
Home/Housewares {.HSW}, and Retail/Stores/Warehouse Clubs
{.RWC}.

____________________________________________________________

3.	Groups That Are Cooling Off

Rankings for Financial/Consumer Loan {.FCL} have plummeted
from the 83rd percentile to the 39th percentile over the past
five weeks on concerns that loan default rates may rise.
Both Americredit {ACF} and Metris {MXT} have seen their stock
prices fall by 20 percent or more during the past two weeks
as investors fear that the rising joblessness rate will force
many consumers into financial problems.  Americredit provides
subprime automobile loans, while Metris offers credit cards
to subprime borrowers.

Other groups with declining rankings include Banks/Savings &
Loan {.BSL}, Electronics/Household Appliances {.EHA},
Finance/Services {.FSE}, and Food/Meat-Poultry {.FMP}.

4.	On The Radar Screen This Week

The retail sector should start coming into play over the
course of the next few weeks as investors digest data out of
three key events.  First are Halloween-related sales - better
than expected revenues will suggest that consumers are
putting the anthrax scares behind them, while worse than
expected sales could suggest that consumer confidence remains
fragile.  Secondly, third quarter earnings season will be
starting for the sector and analysts will be paying close
attention what inventory levels are at and the extent to which
retailers are relying on promotional pricing to drive store
traffic.  Finally, the holiday shopping season is beginning to
warm up and will viewed as a proxy for judging the overall
state of the economy.

It does seem too early to declare victory for the Federal
Reserve Board's monetary policy, but the odds of a recession
have been seriously reduced given the quite positive first
quarter GDP report.  Clearly the initial report is subject to
large revisions, but a revision into negative territory would
be a stretch.  Therefore, an official recession would require
negative "growth" in the second and third quarters - an unlikely
outcome in our view given prior interest rate cuts and a more
stimulative fiscal policy.  That's the good news.

The bad news is that the same GDP report noted a pickup in
inflationary pressures as the personal consumption price
index accelerated quite markedly from the fourth quarter rate.
In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) also
pays quite a bit of attention to the Employment Cost Index (ECI)
which rose at a +4.1% year-over-year rate for the first quarter.
It is these types of pressures that we had in mind when we noted
last week that the FOMC's intermeeting move contained some risks.

One other point worth noting is that the Money Supply has been
growing at an extremely rapid rate.  In this day and age not
many folks pay attention to the money supply data like they used
to, but the liquidity being supplied by the FRB is significant.
Clearly the pace can slow, but my point is that they are
pulling out all the stops to avert a recession, and appear to
have succeeded.  But, in my view, not without incurring some
risk that inflationary pressures will accelerate.

In other words, it is not a given that the FOMC will lower
rates by a half point, or at all, at their May meeting.  Whether
they do or not, and if so to what extent, will now depend upon
forthcoming reports - particularly those providing price
information, such as this coming Friday's Labor Department Report.
And, there is the potential for a positive report.

First, jobless claims have clearly been on a strong uptrend, so
it almost doesn't matter the specific date the survey was taken,
there should be an underlying bias toward continued softness.
And second, beginning of the year price pressures should be
out-of-the-way.  In other words, pay raises that kick in at the
first of the year, making comparisons more difficult, should no
longer distort the data.  Hopefully then, average hourly earnings
will not break out of their recent band, taking some pressure
off the FOMC.

Going forward, the slide in consumer confidence, and the likely
continuing rise in the unemployment rate, should mitigate wage
demands.  And, of course, if the economy does reaccelerate, then
the FOMC will be more likely to use a higher assumption for
productivity growth, so they will tolerate higher wage growth
before being concerned about inflationary pressures.

Simply put, we do not want to be alarmist, but we do want to make
certain that given all the "recession talk", investors understand
that we have not entered a risk free nirvana.  The FOMC has been
very, very aggressive in trying to avoid a recession.  They appear
to have succeeded.  If we have a non "V" recovery (still the best
bet), then inflationary pressures should be contained.

Our concern is that if we, and virtually everyone else, are wrong,
and the  recovery is sharp, then inflationary pressures could
build.  Stay tuned, the "all clear signal" has not yet been rung !

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization. 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:

Alan Quaintance	345-7731

Senate Democrats to Investigate High Energy Prices

t Bush and FERC chairman Hebert are against electricity price  caps, arguin=
g they would discourage firms from building new power plants and do  nothin=
g to encourage conservation. California represents 15% of the economy and  =
any major downturn there would have rippling effects across the nation,  Li=

Canadian Producers Investigate Coal Gas
=20
    Canadian producers are counting on obtaining big natural  gas volumes f=
rom shallow coal seams. Alberta Energy, Nexen, PanCanadian  Petroleum and P=
enn West Petroleum are spending millions of dollars to  investigate whether=
 natural gas trapped in coal beds less than 3,300 feet deep  can be produce=
d economically.  The US derives 7% of its natural gas  production from coal=
 seam gas. Western Canada is estimated to have between 135  Tcf and 260 Tcf=
 of recoverable coal gas. Natural gas fields containing at least  17 Tcf ha=
ve been discovered in Canada's Far North, but bringing them to market  will=
 cost billions to build new pipelines and other facilities. Advocates say  =
many coal deposits sit near existing processing plants and transmission lin=
es,  meaning coal gas fields will be cheaper to connect and produce than Ar=
ctic  reserves. The Alberta Research Council has spent several years resear=
ching ways  to enhance coal gas production and is looking for C$12 million =
to proceed with a  pilot project.=20

El Paso Market Power Abuse Investigation Continues
=20
    FERC's investigation into alleged market power abuse by  El Paso is sti=
ll proceeding a month after it began. Both El Paso and the  California PUC =
have painted contradicting versions of events, and the hearing  looks no cl=
oser to conclusion than when it began. El Paso is attempting to  discredit =
a study prepared by The Brattle Group, a Massachusetts consultant  hired by=
 Edison to find evidence that El Paso Merchant wielded market power. It  du=
tifully concluded that soaring California prices were not caused by regular=
  market forces and pointed to a conspiracy to widen border-basin price spr=
eads.  As part of El Paso's effort to tarnish the study, a professor of pol=
itical  economy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government testified that Br=
attle's tale  doesnt add up. In order to prove market power, he said 3 cond=
itions must be met:  * The system for getting gas to California must not be=
 full; * El Paso Merchant  must have unutilized, but available, delivery ri=
ghts; and * Other shippers must  have fully utilized their delivery rights.=
 The final condition, he says proves  that market power is impossible to es=

Andrew, 

I have a report showing that you are still logging into the Telerate application.  As you know, Telerate is going away soon and will 
no longer be available.   

I also show that you have been migrated to the new Kobra application.  Do you need any help recreating your Telerate pages in Kobra, or 
help linking your Excel models into Kobra?  

If you need additional assistance, please give me a call.

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Systems Trading Update 
Thursday 6-7-01

 
Check this out...
 
ETS - THE ETS Trading Systems - By  Michael A. Mermer CTA.
I have known Michael Mermer and have traded his  systems since 1997.   There are 2 systems: ST - Short Term - Position  Trading and The Fasttrak - Daytrading.  
 
Account Requirements
ST - Short Term - S&P 500/Emini - Position Trading - S&P 500 -  50K / Emini 15K
Fasttrak - Daytrading S&P 500 / Nasdaq  - S&P 500 25K, ND 40K,  Emini S&P 12K, ND Emini 18K
ST - NASDAQ - Short Term - Position Trading - NASDAQ 100 75K, Emini ND  25K
 
ETS - FASTRAK - NASDAQ  - Daytrading - Went Long at 1963.00, Initial Stop Loss 1920, Target  2050 (or 50 points from Entry)  - Exited at 1977    (+$1400  ND, +$260 Emini ND)
 
***If you would like more information please email  me.
 

 
Emini  Daytrader (The Advisor) - Emini & S&P 500 Daytrading - Went  Long at 1280, The 4 point target was narrowly missed so the stop was moved just  below the entry.  Trade exited at the trailing stop  
-1.5 per contract.
 
**The market continued to trade within a narrow range,  which is typical on he days when the contracts "roll" .  Front month  in the S&P 500, DJ 100, Nasdaq 100. etc.  is NOW the September contract  (Symbol "U").  Days like today can be tough trading days especially if  there is not significant buying or selling in the market.  The MAY Chain  Store sales came out at 9:00 CST today and I acyually expected the market to  rally off of the number, but many of the retailers reported less than expected  sales.  The indication I got was that consumers are still spending money  despite a slow down in manufacturing and higher energy prices.  Walmart was  among retailers reporting LOWER sales figures.  
 

Bond Daytrader  - Did not trade today
 
Aggressor  - S&P 500 / Emini - Went LONG at  1279.75
Level 1 +6
Level 2 - 3

Commentary:

Todays price action was roll over day and anything can happen when converting to a new contract month. I am rushing to get this recap out, so todays commentary will be very brief.

We did get jobless claims numbers out and they were bearish up 13,000 much more than expected. This data was the largest gain in claims since 9/92'

When rolling contracts in our system it will always create a second trade in the same day. However todays move on the bullish side in the Sept contract has proven to be a very nice
move. As we write this Globex is at 1291.00 and the nasdaq is 2013 Sept. Intel came out with news that was on a positve note and its up 7% in the night market.


Until tomorrow.


For those of you who know me and we have spoken before. Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my (montra) about trading systems that are available to the retail public. Since I was
introduced to "SYSTEM TRADING" back in 1994.00 and have never looked back, I am more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success. However I
also feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program, and that if its going to have any real long term longevity to it, (then why would
anyone sell it?) The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is.

I found this section in the June edition of Futures magazine, go to page #52 in the middle of the page is a observation from them on tracking systems. And I quote "ALMOST ALL
SUCCESSFUL SYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT-TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS. (THE CONSISTENT SHORT-TERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED.) Un quote.
Well folks the fact is yes it has been developed, its just not for sale? I guess traders will just half to settle for being part of a managed acct with us that has shown to make money.


For those potential clients that are following us one very important aspect of our system is that it feeds on a great deal of data that is transmitted from the cash market. And both
technical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes.We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have
been violated regardless of where the futures are.

What most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity's and futures have there own (platforms) and there own (systems). Its been proven that as long
as one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year. Human
intervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of. It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did "today" but
whats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame. This is the secret for long term success.


On the E-mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8/21/2001 "Single Stock futures" This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be
one of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models. The large firms will
have access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12/21/2001. As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good.

For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all
computer based with there own trading programs.

Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues. For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a
contract. And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year. For more details on this market see details below.

CBOE Create Joint Venture on Single-Stock Futures World's Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For-Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited
Stake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001

 - The world's largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U.S. are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product - single-stock futures contracts. The
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single-stock futures, following
approval by the boards of directors of both exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake. Legislation signed
into law in December will allow the introduction of single-stock futures by U.S. financial exchanges later this year, after an 18-year prohibition on the products. "Today's
announcement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago's exchanges," said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky. "This exciting new
initiative combines the best of securities and futures trading. Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world's center in derivatives
trading and risk management." "The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for
single-stock futures," said CME Chairman Scott Gordon. "Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago
exchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products." "I am enthused that Chicago's exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers' needs
and our members' concerns," said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy. "We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide
great benefit to our members." "Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and
connectivity of the futures and securities worlds," said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty. "This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital
efficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options." "The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new
product to our markets," said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. "The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important
contributions to the success of this venture." The joint venture will be a for-profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated
exchange. Single-stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME's GLOBEX?2 electronic trading
system. CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products. McNulty
said the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC. The exchanges anticipate
contracting with Designated Primary Market-Makers (DPMs) in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,
selection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements. Single-stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and
corporate hedging activities. CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange-for-physicals (EFPs). The Chicago Board
Options Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982. Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40
indexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq-100, and the S&P 100. It remains the world's largest and most successful options
marketplace. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S&P 500 in 1982. Today, CME trades futures and futures options on
indexes including the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e-50? , S&P/BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E-mini
S&P 500 and E-mini Nasdaq-100 contracts - the fastest growing products in the exchange's history. CME also trades interest rate, foreign currency and agricultural commodity products.
On November 13, 2000, CME demutualized and became a for-profit, shareholder-owned corporation. CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CME is regulated by
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Additional information about the CBOE and CME can be found at their respective Web sites: www.cboe.com and www.cme.com.

RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

THE RISK OF LOSS IN TRADING COMMODITIES CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IN
CONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR TO AUTHORIZE SOMEONE ELSE TO TRADE FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:

IF YOU PURCHASE A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND OF ALL TRANSACTION COSTS.

IF YOU PURCHASE OR SELL A COMMODITY FUTURE OR SELL A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE INITIAL MARGIN FUNDS AND ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU DEPOSIT WITH YOUR
BROKER TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST YOUR POSITION, YOU MAY BE CALLED UPON BY YOUR BROKER TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN
FUNDS, ON SHORT NOTICE, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUIRED FUNDS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME, YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED AT A LOSS, AND YOU
WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING DEFICIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT.

UNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO LIQUIDATE A POSITION.  THIS CAN OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE MARKET MAKES A "LIMIT MOVE".  THE PLACEMENT OF
CONTINGENT ORDERS BY YOU OR YOUR TRADING ADVISOR, SUCH AS A "STOP-LOSS" OR "STOP-LIMIT" ORDER, WILL NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT YOUR LOSSES TO THE INTENDED AMOUNTS, SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS
MAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE SUCH ORDERS.

A "SPREAD" POSITION MAY NOT BE LESS RISKY THAN A SIMPLE "LONG" OR "SHORT" POSITION.  THE HIGH DEGREE OF LEVERAGE THAT IS OFTEN OBTAINABLE IN COMMODITY TRADING CAN WORK AGAINST YOU AS
WELL AS FOR YOU.  THE USE OF LEVERAGE CAN LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS.

IN SOME CASES, MANAGED COMMODITY ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY FEES.  IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES
TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFIT TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS.  THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS AT PAGE SEVEN A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH FEE TO BE CHARGED
TO YOUR ACCOUNT BY THE COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR.

THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE COMMODITY MARKETS.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND COMMODITY
TRADING BEFORE YOU TRADE, INCLUDING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT AT PAGE FIVE.

YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR MAY ENGAGE IN TRADING FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS.  TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
INCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES MARKET MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION.  FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES
MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE YOUR TRANSACTIONS MAY BE EFFECTED.  BEFORE YOU TRADE
YOU SHOULD INQUIRE ABOUT ANY RULES RELEVANT TO YOUR PARTICULAR CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND ASK THE FIRM WITH WHICH YOU INTEND TO TRADE FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE TYPES OF REDRESS
AVAILABLE IN BOTH YOUR LOCAL AND OTHER RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS.
 
THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR IS PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ACCEPTING FUNDS IN THE TRADING ADVISOR'S NAME FROM A CLIENT FOR TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS.  YOU MUST PLACE ALL FUNDS FOR
TRADING IN THIS TRADING PROGRAM DIRECTLY WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

Morning Report for Friday, June 8, 2001

http://www.internetstockreport.com/column/article/0,1785,1661_780771,00.html


Intel, Juniper Tell Different Tales

By Paul Shread (mailto:pshread@internet.com)

June 8, 2001 - Yesterday's lack of an earnings warning from Intel (NASDAQ:JNPR) was good news, but this morning's warning from Juniper Networks (NASDAQ:JNPR) was anything but.

And the news from both companies underscores just how tough the current environment is.

After months of not being able to lower guidance fast enough, Intel gave guidance on April 17 that is still holding up seven weeks later. But let's not turn handstands over the news. There were more negatives than positives in Intel's first-ever mid-quarter update. For starters, it's one thing for business to stabilize. It's quite another for it to turn up, and Intel pointedly avoided providing any guidance beyond the June quarter, except that to say that it expects a seasonally strong second half.

Intel said it sees stability in the microprocessor business, although the company expects inventory to be up somewhat over the March quarter. But it continues to see weakness in the communications business, and Juniper drove that point home with an exclamation mark this morning.

Juniper said it sees earnings of 8-9 cents a share this quarter, well below estimates of 24-cent earnings. Revenue guidance was lowered from $300-$330 million to $200-$210 million. For a genuine leader like Juniper, that's a huge warning. The company also announced 8-9% layoffs.

Juniper cited "a challenging service provider and global carrier business environment, brought about by a capacity absorption cycle taking place currently throughout the industry." In other words, all those next-generation service providers, CLECs and long-distance carriers that have sprung up in recent years are undergoing a shakeout of their own, and all the equipment companies that have sprung up to serve them are suddenly seeing business drop out from underneath them. This is not something that Federal Reserve rate cuts are likely to help, and it's likely to affect everyone from shareholders to employees to venture capitalists.

Oddly, this is probably worse news for Ciena (NASDAQ:CIEN), which is now the only telecom equipment company whose earnings are still holding up, than it is for Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Juniper's chief competitor in the router business. Cisco focuses more on the enterprise market, while Ciena has substantial carrier exposure. It will be interesting to see if demand for Ciena's optical equipment can withstand a shakeout in the carrier business, which the Juniper warning signals is clearly underway. The news could also weigh on Avici (NASDAQ:AVCI), which is focused almost entirely on the carrier market.

The Juniper and Intel news made for some interesting technical developments in the after-market and pre-market trading sessions. Intel had cleared 32.57 resistance after its conference call, but dropped back below that level on the Juniper news. And Juniper fell 6 points to 40 support; below that level, the next support is in the 33-36 range.

>From a valuation standpoint, neither stock is a screaming buy at these levels. Intel is trading at 55 times this year's expected earnings, which are predicted to fall 63%. And it is trading at 40 times 2002 estimated earnings, which are expected to be half what the company earned in 2000. For a company with an expected long-term growth rate of 18%, that is one expensive stock.

And we'll have to wait to see how far Juniper's estimates come down before we can calculate a new fair value for that one. But more and more, telecom equipment stocks are beginning to look like a 2002 story.

New Research Report From Dr. Ed Yardeni:
******************************************

STOCK MARKET CYCLES: BOTTOM FISHING
http://www.yardeni.com/public/mktcycle.pdf

During bear markets, stock investors and investment strategists are
constantly on the lookout for the bottom. This time is no different. Indeed,
many of them thought they caught it at the beginning of April this year.
They were wrong.

Picking the exact bottom can be very rewarding, of course. Since 1960, there
have been nine major troughs in the S&P 500, following declines of 15% or
more and averaging minus 24%. After these cyclical lows in stock prices, the
average 12-month gain was an impressive 28%.

In this special issue of the Global Strategist's Handbook, I present
numerous charts relating key economic and financial indicators to the cycle
in stock prices with the focus on finding the ones that are most useful in
picking bottoms. My conclusion is that many of the ones that have worked
best in the past are currently suggesting that the panic-selling low of
September 21 was probably "the" bottom for this cycle.

There are no guarantees: Past performance does not indicate future results,
as we say in the investment business. The low might be retested. A lower low
might still be in the cards. Moreover, even if it was the bottom, the
rebound in stock prices over the next 12 months may be well below the
average, in my judgment, because stocks are not as undervalued as they were
at previous bottoms.

One of the best times to buy stocks is during crises, when panic selling
occurs. The crises usually trigger corrective policy responses, which prove
the doomsayers wrong. So they present great buying opportunities for bargain
hunters. Of course, this is easier said than done. For example, during the
first week that the stock market was open for trading after the Attack, the
right time to buy was on Friday, not Monday. By the end of the following
week, most of the bargains were gone.

Exhibits 3-18 in my latest research report show many of the best market
timing tools, (including a few that are not as useful as widely believed):
price-to-earnings ratios, valuation, the federal funds rate, bond yields,
the yield curve, credit-quality yield spreads, earnings, production,
commodity prices, employment, and money.

Most institutional investors can't raise a great deal of cash while waiting
for the next crisis to create buying opportunities. Most tend to be always
fully invested, so market timing may not be a very relevant exercise for
them. Nevertheless, market timing can help boost performance by identifying
sectors and industries that tend to either underperform or outperform during
a cyclical recovery in stock prices. Exhibits 19-48 in this report are
designed to provide some insights for the selected industries where relative
performance data are available for several years.

BETTER MEDICINE -- Cheaper?Faster?Smarter?

Have you been wondering how you will benefit from the latest medical
discoveries?the human genome project?proteomics?and other increasing
complex bio-medical developments?  Then join Gilder's newest analyst, Dr.
Scott Gottleib for a look at the market prospects in a half hour live
webcast Tuesday June 12th at 2 pm.  There is no fee to attend this
webcast.

Dr Scott Gottlieb is a physician and former Wall Street health care
analyst. He completed his medical degree at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine, where he did research on enzyme deficiencies utilizing
transgenic mice, and continued his medical training in internal medicine
at the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York where he now practices.

THE WEEK/Asterisk for Alan?

"In 1961, Roger Maris hit 61 home runs to break Babe Ruth's 1927 record.
Unfortunately, it took him eight more games than Ruth. For the next thirty
years, an asterisk differentiated his record from Ruth's 60 home run
total, denying Maris the satisfaction of his accomplishment.

"Today, as Alan Greenspan winds down his career, his otherwise stellar
record is threatened with an asterisk as well. After a record-breaking
recovery, high-tech stocks have crashed, the economy is closer to
recession than it has been in over a decade, and many think that inflation
is returning.

"The Fed has cut rates faster in 2001 than at any time since 1982, when
the economy was in the worst recession since the Great Depression and
inflation was rising at double-digit rates. Greenspan is managing the
economy on the run, reacting to economic developments, not anticipating
them. After years of seeming in control, the Fed looks out of control."

Brian Wesbury updates the Greenspan legacy in The American Spectator's
June issue. Read the full text at www.gilder.com, and subscribe online at

IN THE DIGITAL POWER REPORT/Photon Power

"Low-power lasers can handle most bit-moving, think-and-see applications
just fine. Indeed, too much power becomes a problem when the objective is
to send a beam through the very narrow core of a strand of glass, or down
to the micron-sized pits on a compact disk. But our economy moves atoms,
too, and atoms are a lot heavier than bits. If it's powerful enough,
highly ordered light lets us move atoms--stuff--a million times better
than the old tools of the thermal and mechanical world. It permits
ultra-fine heating, soldering, drilling, cutting, and materials
processing, with fantastic improvements in speed, precision, and
efficiency. Nothing can move atoms more finely than photons can.

"Highly ordered light has already transformed the think/see
telecommunications legacy of Alexander Graham Bell. The industrial
legacies of Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and Henry Ford come next.
The move laser is destined to become as ubiquitous in the atom-moving
economy as its low-power counterpart already is in CD players and desktop
printers. The second photonic revolution is at hand."

Peter Huber and Mark Mills go photonic in June's Digital Power Report,

IN NEW ECONOMY WATCH/Opportunity Knocks

"It took Microsoft's antitrust trial to convince Silicon Valley that
Washington DC had not already lapsed into the irrelevance it may well
someday achieve. That's clearly not the case at Enron, where CEO Ken Lay
(a former official of the old Federal Power Commission, it's worth noting)
isn't given to underestimating either the sharpness of political teeth or,
more importantly, the potential gold mines in deregulation. Lay was the
2000 Bush campaign's largest single contributor, which undoubtedly had
nothing whatsoever to do with the half-hour chat he got with Dick Cheney,
just as the Vice President was putting together the White House's new
energy initiative. Top of Lay's agenda: creation of an open national
electricity grid, where a markets-based innovator like Enron can skate
rings around entrenched local and regional utilities. No prizes for
guessing what's front and center in the Bush administration's energy
plans.

"But all that said, ENE's roller-coaster performance over the past six
months shows the kinds of curve balls that regulation (or in this case,
the mere threat of it, from California) can throw. And the energy circus,
for that matter, is a walk in the park compared with the professional
wrestling underway in telecom, featuring Beltway heavyweights such as
Austin-based SBC, the rest of the Baby Bells and AT&T, all demanding their
(often mutually exclusive) due. Rookie FCC referee Michael Powell is
making all the right deregulatory noises. What he needs now is Jesse
Ventura."

Stambovsky on telecom debt and wide-ranging insights from across the
investment landscape. Subscribe now at www.neweconomywatch.com.

FRIDAY FEATURE/Money For Nothing

In  those famously heady days of 1999, first-day IPO run-ups left an
amazing $37 billion "on the table"--in the pockets of those lucky enough
to get a pre-market share allotments, rather than in the coffers of the
companies ostensibly raising money to fund their future growth. In the
first six months of 2000, another $20 billion followed--roughly twice what
the underwriters earned in fees, and an infinite multiple of many of the
issuers' actual earning prospects. Divide that by various burn rates, and
a lot of now-famous belly-ups might still be around.

"Money on the table" has fuelled much gnashing of investor teeth, and
plenty of conspiracy theories as well. It's also the raison d'etre for our
good friends at W.H. Hambrecht & Co, whose Dutch auction-style IPO
underwriting is getting renewed attention in today's more
efficiency-conscious markets. In "Why Don't Issuers Get Upset About
Leaving Money on the Table in IPOs?"  Notre Dame's Tim Loughran and Jay
Ritter of the University of Florida run the numbers on the whole amazing
business, and offer some theories about why it won't be going away anytime
soon. Download the full monograph at
http://bear.cba.ufl.edu/ritter/parnov.htm.

(A tip of the hat to our friend and FT columnist Peter Martin for spotting
the report. Kudos as well to the excellent Review of Financial Studies
Online, a treasure trove of investment-related research available free at

Team
First I would like to Thank You for you commitment, diligence and excellence you have provided to the BRM Deal thus far. 

We are now entering a phase where you will be required to complete assignments in a timely fashion in order to provide the necessary content for this project. The content directly determines how great the end product of this project will be for Enron and possibly third parties (i.e. be mindful and raise red flags when content might expose an Enron competitive advantage). 

In addition, to scheduled meetings with the Accenture team, your assignments will have two phases. One, you will provide the content to build a specific topic. Two, you will review the content provided by another Content SME and provide input on their work product. Thus each topic of our content will be reviewed by two Content SME's.  Below you will find the assignment table as well as the following:
	Knowledge System Responsibilities for SME's

assignment for a given week, please notify me & Accenture ahead of time and
provide a date for when you will complete the assignment.

Again, Thanks for providing your expertise to this deal and I look forward as usual for us to exceed the mark as this is the Enron way.

Cheers
Kirk

The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group.

In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. 

Crude and Products group
Mid-marketing
Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.  

Origination
In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. 

Trading
Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas.  

Shipping
Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.

Weather
The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline.  

Coal
Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia.

Enron Japan
The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities.

LNG
LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.

Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region.

Enron Freight Markets
EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products.  

Global Risk Markets
David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup.

Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance.

In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk.

Financial Trading
Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.  

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to the continued growth in all the EGM businesses.

IN THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR/"The Coming Boom"

"In every era, the definitive abundance is revealed by the price of a key
factor of production, plummeting over a cliff of costs and releasing. Like
a giant river reaching a falls, the key resource releases a surge of
kinetic energy into the economy as the price drops. From horsepower to
kilowatt hours, the countries, companies and individuals that exploit the
ever-cheaper resource gain market share against all others, and end up
casting the character of the age.

"Over the last forty years, the key resource has been transistors and bits
of memory. The new era, however, will ride a new factor of production over
a new paradigm cliff: the price of communications bandwidth, falling
between two and ten times as fast as the fall in the price of transistors.

"The plummeting price of a key resource creates what my friend Andy
Kessler calls a low-pressure area in the economy. Low-pressure systems
pull in weather from elsewhere(storms. Conventional economists have long
favored equilibrium-economies that gravitate toward perfect balance, blue
skies and moderate weather. This remains the ideal of Eurosclerosis. In
entrepreneurial economies, however, low-pressure zones such as Silicon
Valley concentrate energy in spirals of growth, twisters of creative
destruction.

"Driving today's low-pressure economy is the rampant spread of the
Internet and its transformation through the power of fiber optics. The
Internet lowers the cost of transactions, of price information, and of
search, and facilitates the setting of prices. The Internet saves the key
scarcity of the new economy of abundance-time. Extending markets and
proliferating new products, it lowers the cost of capitalism and raises
the comparative price of socialist policy.

"The low-pressure economy drives prices down most dramatically in the
highest growth sectors such as technology-and these low prices reverberate
throughout the economy. Pondering the numbers, many economists will
continue to warn against inflation and call for tighter money, as they did
throughout much of the Great Depression. They will oppose tax rate
reductions in order to pay back debt or balance the budget, as Americans
did in the 1930s and the Japanese did during the 1990s.

"If the current administration and Federal Reserve follow those
well-trodden paths of failure, they will delay the tidal wave of new
growth. But they cannot stop it. The world economy is increasingly unified
and if the U.S. gives up leadership, other countries will move into the
low-pressure breach. Bad policy can drive American venture capital
overseas, just as bad policy in Japan and Europe shifted capital to the
U.S. over the last two decades. But the Telecosm will still prevail, and
investors who understand its dimensions will be able to spurn the
catastrophists and prosper from the largest opportunity in the history of
the world economy."

IN THE MAY 2001 DYNAMIC SILICON/MEMS Meet Data Storage

"Two forces encourage the development of MEMS-based data storage:
proliferating portable devices and the superparamagnetic limit. Small
devices need cheap, rugged, capacious data storage. Hard disks are within
a few generations of reaching the superparamagnetic limit, where bit sizes
are too small to remember their data (thermal noise randomizes the bits).
The search has begun for alternatives to longitudinal magnetic recording."

FRIDAY FEATURE/Eve of Disruption?

The GTR's irrepressible optics analyst Charlie Burger writes:

Somewhere over the rainbow, in a motley lab infested with neoteric lenses
and microscopic mirrors, two optical gurus ply their genius toward the
ultimate WDM multiplexer. Avanex is in their crosshairs, IPO on their
minds. Then a VC slips up, a long-winded, eccentric professor drops the
wrong hint, and suddenly they're on our radar and splashed all over the
next GTR. Disruption!

Those mythic geeks-and merely mythic they are-have another hideout: in the
psyches of anyone invested in (or thinking about) Avanex and other
Telecosm companies. Indeed, if my story were true, how could we know?
Techno-pundits point to disrupters here, there, and everywhere-they're
swarming out of the telecosmic woodwork into the fibers of your portfolio.
MEMS, photonic switches, tunable lasers, holey fiber, optical integrated
circuits, silicon optical amplifiers-all have been portentously declared
'disruptive' at one time or another. And then heads turn. Wallets open.
It's the flavor of the month.

Then again, the true disrupters may already have surfaced-and just haven't
yet been identified. How do we know if a technology disrupts or sustains?
Can you determine if an industry or industry segment is in "overshoot" or
"undershoot"? How long will it take for a disruptive (or sustaining)
technology to overtake the old ways? Is the last one in a rotten egg, or
is it first in, first out? Well, it depends. Will today's paradigmatic
technology be paradigmatic tomorrow?

Avanex and its closest rival, Chorum Technologies ("co-conspirators,"
really, since Chorum legitimizes the Avanex vision and helps create a much
larger market), get new competitors daily. Arroyo Optics, Optoplex,
Southampton Photonics, Wavesplitter, Oplink, JDSU, New Focus, all boasting
new ways to combine and separate colors of light onto a fiber-optic
thread. I've undoubtedly missed a few others. And still more companies
claim all-optical add/drop multiplexers, another key WDM component.

So should you be sweating over Avanex? Based on our ongoing analysis of
multiplexing technologies, I'd say no. But if you're determined to sweat
it anyway-or to sweat any other Telecosm company or technology-here's a
favor you can do yourself. Visit our old friend and former colleague
Clayton Christensen's web site, www.innosight.com Download his new report,
"After the Gold Rush: Patterns of Success and Failure on the Internet."
It's a lot more than a dot-com post-mortem-more an update to his
bestselling book, "The Innovator's Dilemma" (which you've read twice over,
right?). "After the Gold Rush" gives you what you need to become the Dick
Tracy of disruptive optics or disruptive whatever-else. And put an end to
flippant disruptionism.

P.S. Is the Internet a disruptive or sustaining technology? Think hard and
take a stab at the answer. Then read the first page of Gold Rush and find
out why you're wrong.

Andrew,

KEY EVENTS TO WATCH FOR:

1:00 PM ET. Philadelphia Fed Bank President Anthony Santomero speaks
to Risk Management Association on U.S. economy in Philadelphia.

4:15 PM ET. Commercial/Industrial loans.

KEY HEADLINES:

German Industrial production falls again and below forecasts.

Sterling hits a new low as the Labour victory brings EMU to fore.

UK's Blair to open second term with Cabinet reshuffle.

Eurostat: Euro-zone 1st estimate Q1 GDP up 0.5% verses Q4 2000.

Takenaka unsure if Japan will hit 1.2% target growth in 2000-01.

Japan's May domestic wholesale price index down 0.6% on the year.

ECB president tells newspaper he wants to boost bank's credibility.

Italy Treasury to cut 2001 GDP growth target to 2.4% says report.

Frances's Schneider shares fall after raising bid for rival Legrand.

The STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS

The NASDAQ and S&P 500 were higher overnight as they extend
Thursday's gains. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that
the rebound off last week's low is likely to continue into mid-June.
Closes above May's highs would renew this spring's rallies. Until
then one should view present rallies as corrective bounces.
Meanwhile, the Dow posted an upside reversal on Thursday following
Wednesday's corrective break. Momentum indicators are bullish
signaling that additional gains during June are possible.

European markets were higher in overnight trading despite a decline
in Germany's decline in industrial production and the continued fall
in sterling. Modest support due to gains on Wall Street led by chip-
related stocks along with a reassuring report from Intel Corp helped
underpin European stock markets overnight. The UK FTSE-100 was up
18.90 points at 5967.20 while the German DAX-30 was up 70.70 points
at 6254.95 as of 11:00 BST.

The Nikkei closed higher overnight as high-technology stocks
benefited from the Nasdaq's rally overnight and Intel Corp.'s
positive performance update. Overnight gains confirmed Thursday's
upside reversal as the Nikkei extended this week's rebound following
a test of the 50% retracement level crossing at 12,995. Friday's
gains have turned a number of oversold momentum indicators neutral to
bullish signaling that a short-term bottom has likely been posted.
The Nikkei closed up 152 points to 13,430.

INTEREST RATES

September bonds were slightly lower overnight due to spillover
selling following Thursday's round of profit taking, which led to a
key reversal down. Additional weakness during the day session would
confirm Thursday's bearish reversal pattern thereby increasing the
odds that a short-term top has likely been posted. Momentum
indicators are bullish but poised to turn bearish with additional
weakness.

The German bond market or Bunds were lower overnight. Dealers and
technical traders will be watching to see if the lower prices
realized over the past two sessions are enough to draw real money
investors into the markets. The risk in the market is still focused
on the euro and there is enough uncertainty there to keep investors
on the sidelines. The Sept. Bunds were last down 0.03 at 106.48.

Japanese government bonds closed lower overnight as traders closed
out their long positions ahead of the current lead June futures last
trading day on Monday. Firmness in the Nikkei weighed on JGB futures.

The ENERGY MARKETS were mostly higher in overnight trading due to
short covering triggered by refinery snags caused by stormy weather
in the U.S. Gulf. Additional support came from news that Exxon's
Baytown, Texas 110,000 bpd catcracker shut down on Wednesday for
repairs.

July crude oil was higher overnight in narrow trading as it continues
to consolidate above this year's uptrend line, which crosses near
27.10. Momentum indicators are bearish but oversold warning traders
to use caution as a short-term bottom might be near. Closes above
Monday's high crossing at 28.74 would temper the near-term bearish
outlook in July crude.

July heating oil was higher overnight as it is working on a potential
inside day. July's inability to close below Wednesday's low, which
now appears to have marked a double bottom sets the stage for a
possible short covering bounce in the near future. Closes below
Wednesday's low would set the stage for a test of May's reaction low
crossing at 74.55. Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming
oversold warning bears that a corrective bounce is possible.

July unleaded gas was higher overnight due to light short covering as
it continues to consolidate below broken trendline support. Momentum
indicators are bearish but oversold hinging that a pause or
corrective bounce is possible near-term. If the decline resumes,
April's reaction low crossing at 85.40 is July's next target.

July Henry Hub natural gas was lower overnight in narrow trading as
it continues to consolidate above last week's low. Closes below this
support level would renew this year's decline while opening the door
for a possible test of the 62% retracement level of the 1999/2001
rally crossing at 3.64 later this month. Momentum indicators are
turning bearish once again signaling that additional weakness is
possible.

CURRENCIES

The September Euro is working on a possible inside day but was
slightly lower overnight as it continues to extend this week's narrow
trading range. Closes below 84.16 would renew this spring's decline.
Momentum indicators are neutral to bearish thereby leaving the door
open for additional weakness. It would take closes above this week's
high crossing at 85.85 to temper the near-term bearish outlook in the
euro.

The September British Pound plunged to a new 15-year low overnight
following the Labour Party's victory this week. This week's breakout
below long-term chart support crossing at 139.52 has opened the door
for a test of the February 1986 low at 136 later this spring.
Momentum indicators are bearish signaling sideways to lower prices
are possible near-term.

The September Swiss Franc was lower overnight as it extends its
decline following Wednesday's key reversal down. Closes into new lows
would set the stage for a possible test of weekly chart support
crossing at .5508 later this year. The ADX (a trend-following
indicator) remains in a bearish mode signaling that additional
weakness is still possible.

The September Canadian Dollar was higher overnight as it is
challenging the 62% retracement level of this year's decline crossing
at .6573. Multiple closes above this resistance level would confirm a
breakout thereby opening the door for a possible test of February's
gap, which begins at .6600. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling
that sideways to higher prices during the first half of June are
possible.

The September Japanese Yen turned lower overnight thereby ending
Thursday's corrective bounce. With a short-term top now in place, the
door is open for sideways to lower prices into mid-June as the
September yen is resuming this spring's trading range. Stochastics
and RSI have turned bearish signaling that additional weakness is
likely.

PRECIOUS METALS

August comex gold was higher in overnight trading as it continues to
extend the narrow trading range, which has formed around the 75%
retracement level of the decline off May's high crossing at 267.20.
Closes above 269.60 are needed to temper the near-term bearish
outlook in August gold. If the decline resumes, the reaction low
crossing at 263.20 is August's next target. Stochastics and RSI are
bearish but oversold warning bears not to press their hand as a low
may be near.

July silver was slightly higher in narrow trading overnight as it
consolidates above trading range support crossing at 4.31. Closes
below this support level crossing at 4.31 would open the door for a
possible test of weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month.
Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness
near-term is possible.

July copper plunged to new contract lows overnight thereby renewing
its decline off May's high and is challenging weekly support crossing
at 74.10. Closes below this support level could lead to a test of
weekly support crossing at 72.70 later this month. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are
still possible.

GRAINS

July corn was lower overnight due to light profit taking following
Thursday's low-range close. Uncertainties over extended weather
forecast and ideas that it's too early to push the panic button
despite declining crop conditions weighed on corn prices late
Thursday and in the overnight trade. I would not be surprised to see
additional profit taking during the day session, as traders are
unlikely to press the long side of the market ahead of the weekend.
Next Monday's crop conditions report will likely show another decline
in ratings due to this week's cool/wet weather across the Midwest. It
would take closes above Thursday's high at 2.01 1/2 to set the stage
for a test of May's high crossing at 2.11 1/2 later this month. Early
calls are for July corn to open a 1/2 to 1 cent lower this morning.

July wheat was fractionally higher in overnight trading due to
spillover support from Thursday's strong export sales and continued
hot/dry conditions across China. Additional support came from wet
conditions across portions of the Plains, which has slowed winter
wheat harvest. Wednesday's test of the contract low at 2.58 1/2 may
have also marked a double bottom. However, it will take closes above
last Friday's high at 2.72 before this is confirmed. Stochastics and
RSI are diverging and turning bullish hinting that a short-term
bottom may be in place. I am looking for an inside day as traders are
unlikely to take a major position ahead of the weekend. Early calls
are for July wheat to open steady to 3/4 of a cent higher this
morning.

SOYBEAN COMPEX

July soybeans were lower in overnight trading due to light profit
taking following Thursday's steady close. Uncertainties over the
extended weather forecasts for the Midwest leave the market
vulnerable to additional profit taking during the day session. The
cool/wet conditions that have dominated Midwest weather this week
should be reflected in next Monday's planting progress report. At the
same time, emergence concerns and slow crop development along with
continued strong demand should continue to underpin both old and
new-crop prices. Momentum indicators are bullish but nearing their
respective overbought zones warning bulls to use caution. Early calls
for July soybeans to open 2 to 2 3/4 cents lower this morning.

July soybean meal was also lower overnight due to light profit taking
following Thursday's spike above the 62% retracement level of this
winter's decline crossing at 169.40. Additional weakness during the
day session is needed to confirm Thursday's downside reversal, which
would then increase the odds that a short-term top might have been
posted. At the same time strong domestic and foreign demand along
with a tight cash market will continue to underpin the meal market
thereby limiting near-term downside risk. Early calls are for July
soybean meal to open a $1.00 to $1.10 lower this morning.

LIVESTOCK

August hogs closed modestly higher on Thursday due to improving
cutout values and spillover strength from bellies. Light fund and
cash connected buying also underpinned today's rally. Today also
marked the official start of the Goldman roll as they were selling
July and buying August. If the rally resumes, April's high crossing
at 65.95 is August's next target. Closes below last week's gap at
64.00 would strongly suggest that a short-term top has been posted.

August cattle extended this week's decline closing lower for the
fourth day in a row. However, a short covering bounce ahead of the
close tempered some of today's losses leading to a mid-range close. A
short covering bounce on Friday is possible as traders bank some of
this week's short profits. Momentum indicators have turned bearish
signaling sideways to lower prices into mid-June are possible.

FOOD & FIBER

July coffee closed lower on Thursday due to bearish short-term
weather forecasts for Brazil's coffee growing region. July remains
poised to test the late-May low crossing at 57.10. Closes below this
support level would renew this year's decline. However, momentum
indicators are oversold hinting that a short-term low is in place or
near. Closes above 60.80 are needed to temper the near-term bearish
outlook in the market.

July cocoa closed into new lows for the week thereby confirming the
recent breakout below this spring's trading range, which crosses at
955. Today's new low close for the month has renewed the decline off
May's high while setting the stage for a test of fib support crossing
at 862 later this month.

July sugar closed lower on Thursday thereby confirming yesterday's
key reversal down. Today's loss was enough to keep momentum
indicators bearish, as the stage is set for a possible test of last
week's low at 839. Closes below this support level would renew the
decline off May's high and open the door for a test of fib support
crossing at 832 then 808 later this month.

July cotton closed lower on Thursday as it continues to consolidate
above psychological support crossing at 40-cents. Closes above this
year's downtrend line crossing near 43.95 are needed to confirm a
bottom and trend change has taken place. Momentum indicators are
neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices near-term
are possible.

_____________________________________________________________________

The STOCK INDEXES closed lower on Friday as today's halt in trading
on the big board due to software problems caused nervous traders and
investors to dump stocks ahead of the weekend. This led to the
posting of a key reversal down in September S&P's and a lower close
in the Nasdaq. Additional weakness in both markets on Monday would
increase the odds that the corrective bounces off the late-May lows
might have run their course for the time being.

The Dow closed lower on Friday due in part to today's software
glitch, which halted trading on the big board for the first time
since 1998. Nervous traders dumped stocks due to uncertainties over
the half in trading as the decline off Tuesday's high continues.
Momentum indicators have turned bearish with this week's setback
signaling that additional weakness is possible. Closes below last
week's low crossing at 10,835.40 would renew the Dow's decline off
May's high and set the stage for a test of May's low crossing at
10,673.20 later this month.

INTEREST RATES September bonds closed lower on Friday thereby
confirming Thursday's key reversal down. Today's decline turned a
number of momentum indicators neutral to bearish hinting that the
corrective bounce off the late-May low might have come to an end with
Thursday's high. Additional weakness on Monday could lead to an
eventual test of broken trendline resistance drawn across this
spring's highs.

The CRB INDEX posted a key reversal up on Friday erasing all of this
week's losses in the process. Strength in oilseeds, hogs, bellies,
some precious metals, foods, fiber and crude oil underpinned today's
rally. Today's high-range close leaves the door open for a steady to
higher opening on Monday as closes above 211.75 would renew the
rebound off the late-May low crossing at 208.43. Momentum indicators
are oversold and are turning neutral warning bears to use caution, as
additional short covering is possible during June.

ENERGY MARKETS closed higher on Friday due to short covering as they
consolidated some of this week's losses ahead of the weekend. Gains
were limited as worries over refinery snags and crude oil offloading
affected by stormy weather in the U.S. Gulf dissipated.

July crude oil rebounded on Friday erasing all of this week's losses
to post a positive close for the week. Momentum indicators are
oversold and turning neutral to bullish hinting that a short-term low
was posted with Wednesday's spike of this year's uptrend line. It
will take closes above 29.05 to temper the near-term bearish outlook
in the market.

July heating oil posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday
due to short covering ahead of the weekend. Closes above this week's
high at 78.40 would confirm that Wednesday's low marked a double
bottom, which coincides with the 38% retracement level of the
December/May rally crossing at 75.66.

July unleaded gas closed slightly higher on Friday as it extended
Thursday's short covering bounce following this week's trendline
breakout. Session lows tested the 50% retracement level crossing at
88.93. This week's trendline breakout has opened the door for
additional weakness during June. If the decline resumes, the 62%
retracement level of this year's rally crossing at 85.62 is July's
next target. The daily ADX (a trend-following indicator) remains in a
bearish mode signaling that additional weakness is possible.

July Henry Hub natural gas posted a key reversal up on Friday due to
light short covering ahead of the weekend. Forecasts calling for a
warm-up across the Midwest next week and continued heat in the South
are expected to raise demand for natural gas, which triggered today's
rally. Closes above 4.179 or below 3.67 are needed to clear up
near-term direction in the market.

CURRENCIES The September Dollar closed slightly higher on Friday as
it continues to grind sideways to higher this spring. The daily ADX
(a trend-following indicator) is bullish signaling that additional
strength is possible as the door remains open for a test of weekly
resistance crossing at 121.50 later this month. It would take closes
below May's uptrend line crossing near 118.62, which coincides with
gap support to signal that a short-term top has likely been posted.

The September Swiss Franc closed slightly higher on Friday due to
light short covering ahead of the weekend. September continues to
consolidate above the contract lows but remains poised to renew this
spring's decline possibly next week. Wednesday's key reversal down is
still a warning to traders that the underlying tone of the market
remains weak. The daily ADX is still in a bearish trend mode
signaling that additional weakness is possible.

The September Canadian Dollar extended this week's rally as it spiked
above the 62% retracement level of this winter's decline crossing at
.6573. If this resistance level is clear, gap resistance beginning at
.6600 is September's next upside target. Closes below broken
resistance crossing at .6541 would increase the odds that a
short-term top has likely been posted. Momentum indicators are
bullish but overbought warning bulls to use caution as a short-term
top might be near.

The September Japanese Yen renewed this week's decline with a lower
close on Friday. The setback from last week's high has returned
September to this spring's trading range. Momentum indicators have
turned bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices during the
first half of June are possible. If the decline continues, gap
support crossing at .8272 is September's next target.

PRECIOUS METALS August gold vaulted sharply higher on Friday due to
short covering. Trading volume was thin, which helped exaggerate
today's gains. Nevertheless, a short-term bottom has been confirmed
with the recent consolidation around the 75% retracement level of
this spring's rally crossing at 267.20. Today's rally turned
short-term momentum indicators bullish signaling that additional
gains into mid-June are possible. A setback is likely on Monday as
today's gains were overdone.

July silver also closed higher on Friday as it posted a key reversal
up. Session lows tested trading range support crossing at 4.31 cents.
Stochastics and RSI are bearish but oversold hinting that a
short-term bottom may have been posted with today's low. Additional
gains on Monday are needed to help confirm today's bullish reversal
pattern. Closes below 4.31 would open the door for a possible test of
weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month.

July copper plunged to new contract lows and below weekly support
crossing at 74.10 as it renewed this spring's decline. Weekly support
crossing at 72.85 is July's next target. Stochastics and RSI are
bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible.
Today's sell off was triggered by fund liquidation due to concerns
over the global economy.

GRAINS July corn closed lower on following Thursday's poor close and
weekend weather forecast for the Midwest, which should allow for a
warm up that should spur improved crop development next week. Losses
were limited due to dry weather concerns in China and expectations
that next Monday's crop conditions report will come in steady to
slightly below this week's levels. Momentum indicators remain bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices into mid-June are possible.
Closes above minor resistance at $2.00 are needed to set the stage
for a possible test of May's high at 2.11 1/2 later this month.

July wheat closed fractionally lower on Friday as it consolidated
some of its late-week gains. Losses were limited due to reports of
heavy rains across parts of the hard red winter wheat belt overnight,
which raised concerns about further crop losses. Gains this week
remains limited due to sluggish world wheat demand and U.S. winter
wheat harvest, which has moved into southern Oklahoma. Closes above
2.72 or below 2.58 1/2 is needed to clear up near-term direction in
the market. Stochastics are giving a divergent buy signal hinting
that sideways to higher prices are possible next week.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans posted its highest close since March
13th as it extends its trading range breakout. The stage is set for a
test of March's high crossing at 4.77 1/2. Continued strength in the
cash markets along with strong foreign and domestic demand continues
to underpin the late-spring rally. Commodity funds were active buyers
across the complex buying about 1,000 contracts of soybeans. Momentum
indicators remain bullish signaling that additional gains are
possible.

July soybean meal closed sharply higher on Friday and above the 62%
retracement level crossing at 169.40 to keep this spring's uptrend
alive. Today's breakout above fib resistance has opened the door for
a possible test of the 75% retracement level of this winter's decline
crossing at 175.40 later this month. Strong foreign and domestic
demand along with a tight cash market continues to underpin meal's
rally. The daily ADX has resumed its bullish trend mode signaling
that additional strength is possible.

LIVESTOCK August hogs closed sharply higher on Friday falling just
short of the contract high at 65.95. Fund related buying along with
local short covering triggered today's rally due to tight supplies
and ideas of firming cash bids and higher cut-out values. Additional
support came from the Goldman roll as they continue to buy the August
contract. This week's rally has turned weekly momentum indicators
bullish signaling that additional gains are possible. I would not be
surprised to see a brief period of consolidation around 65.95 next
week.

August cattle gave us the short covering bounce ahead of the weekend
that I was looking for as it consolidated some of this week's losses.
While additional short covering is possible on Monday, momentum
indicators have turned bearish warning traders that last week's high
likely marked a broad double top with January's high. Expectations
for seasonal weakness during June should continue to put pressure on
August cattle next week.

FOOD & FIBER July coffee closed slightly higher on Friday due to
short covering ahead of the weekend. July's ability to hold above the
late-May low of 57.10 leaves the door open for a short covering
bounce next week should weather forecasts for Brazil's coffee growing
region turn bullish. Momentum indicators are oversold hinting that a
short-term low is in place or near. Closes above 60.80 are needed to
temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market.

July cocoa posted an upside reversal with a higher close on Friday
due to short covering ahead of the weekend. July's inability to
sustain Thursday's move to new lows hints that a short-term low might
be in place. Stochastics and RSI are oversold warning traders not to
press the short side of the market at this time.

July sugar closed higher on Friday erasing the losses of the past two
trading sessions. While today's bounce was expected, it does bring
into question whether or not the rebound off last week's double
bottom has ended or if there is one more leg up in the correction
before the larger-degree decline off May's high resumes. Momentum
indicators are bearish but nearing their respective oversold zones
warning bears to use caution and not to press the short side of the
market at this time.

July cotton closed out the week on a high note as it continues to
rebound off the late-May lows. However, floor sources indicate that
there has been little fundamental news to support this month's short
covering rally, which leaves the market vulnerable to a resumption of
this year's decline later this month. Stochastics and RSI have turned
bullish signaling that additional short covering into mid-June is
possible. If the rebound continues, trendline resistance crossing
near 43.25 is the next target.

Hey, Just following up with some of you to let you know that Scott and I
were married on Saturday, November 10th.  The wedding was great and the
honeymoon was even better.  I highly recommend St. Lucia for a vacation
spot.

Here is my new information:

Scott and Michelle Minor

Decatur, GA 30030

404-687-8191 (home)
404-434-5159 (my cell - same)

INVESTNEWSWIRE WEEK IN REVIEW
Week Ending June 8, 2001

IN THIS ISSUE:
* Company Highlight : Learncom, Inc.(OTCBB - LRCM)
* This Week's Top 10 News Links

COMPANY SPOTLIGHT : Learncom, Inc.

Lloyd Singer, President and CEO of Learncom
(OTCBB: LRCM - news) in an open letter to
shareholders provided the following recap of its
strategy and progress since the company started its
business in January, 1999:

Said Singer: "Our goal is to become the major
supplier of soft skills training resources and
related services in the highly fractionated $60
billion training industry. From humble beginnings,
with just twelve employees - all shareholders or option
holders - housed in our warehouse in Bensenville,
Illinois, we've been successful in acquiring four
synergistic product-centric businesses with copyright
or distribution rights to several thousand training
videos, CD-ROMs and e-learning courses. Two other
acquisitions are anticipated for 2001.

The same low overhead, flat organization approach to
the business that we started with has been a cornerstone
of our corporate culture. Build the salespower. Encourage
cross-selling. Reduce the redundant overheads inherent in
an acquisition strategy. Everybody an owner.

The first acquisition in January, 1999 included the high
quality video assets (several hundred titles) of
WingsNet, Inc. and provided the foundation to get the
business started. By midyear, '99 we were cash neutral
on just $750,000 in sales and provided our backers with
the confidence to fund further growth.

In August, 1999, we acquired the stock of BNA
Communications, a 50 year producer/distributor of
high quality video courseware specializing in harassment
prevention, diversity and employment law. The company
had been a subsidiary of The Bureau of National Affairs,
the large Washington, D.C. publisher and information
provider to the legal and HR professions.

The business also included a start-up consulting
practice in the same subject areas. The top ten video
courses all had generated sales in excess of $2 million
in revenue - a very strong result in our business. As
announced a few weeks ago, we're now preparing
the release of A WINNING BALANCE II, the
sequel to the title of the same name which has generated
revenues of over $5 million and is believed to be the
best selling diversity course in history. These courses
have been produced by ProGroup, Inc. a leading
consulting company in the diversity area.

Another major change we've made with the BNAC
business model is the sales approach. For years,
BNAC had rejected the ``open'' sales model used in the
training business. In this model, titles are sold by
the producer's own sales staff as well as through other
distributors. LearnCom has just signed a
non-exclusive deal with a small, but highly
productive distributor to sell BNAC best-sellers.
In addition, LearnCom's other sales units will be
selling BNAC courses. Ultimately we expect to roll
out the product to more than 200 distributors with
300 salespeople. Early results are encouraging from
these decisions..

In January, 2001, we acquired the stock of venerable
distributor, VideoLearning Systems, Inc. (VLS).
This deal provided an additional eight salespeople,
and three excellent managers. Integration is proceeding
on schedule. VLS is on track to generate $2.5 million
in revenue in 2001.

In March, we announced "agreement in principle" to
acquire the trainseek.com website, www.trainseek.com.
This huge B2B site, which provides access to over
one million training titles across the broad spectrum
of platforms and formats is expected to become
the main marketing engine for the company. With
over 19,000 visitors monthly and its large
e-mail list, we can now sell the largest product
line ever assembled in the training industry to the
largest potential customer base. TrainSeek, Inc.
had invested over $7 million in developing the site
and establishing the brand. This deal is
expected to close in early July.

Next up for 2001 is a distribution deal that has the
potential to double our size to the $11million level.
More importantly, on a proforma basis, we'll have the
scale to break into the black...a key goal for management
since we opened our doors in that warehouse just 30
months ago. Last week, we announced the $4 million
fund-raising that will facilitate closing of the new
transaction as well as providing capital for additional
transactions and working capital for sales, marketing
and product development.

I'm pleased but not complacent with our progress.
This is all about dedicated people, all owners or
owners-to-be working to serve thousands of customers
with an outstanding lineup of training products and
services that enhance employee performance in thousands
of companies. This is also about stockholders who
continue to have faith in our Vision and Growth."

___________________________________________


Simtek Adds Manufacturing Capacity

Simtek Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: SRAM), is adding
equipment required to increase manufacturing volumes of its
nonvolatile memory products.

In cooperation with its subcontract test facility, Amkor Test Services
of Wichita, Kansas, Simtek is installing additional printed circuit
boards required to electrically exercise nvSRAM products. The
equipment is specifically designed to support 32 pin surface mount
packaging used for 256Kbit devices. The equipment will be on line
and operational by the end of June, increasing manufacturing
capacity of STK14C88N parts by 30%.

``Last year, industry-wide silicon wafer shortages restricted our
ability to supply the market demand for some products,'' stated
Douglas Mitchell, Simtek's president and CEO. ``That shortage is
now resolved, so we are addressing the remaining issues to increase
production output. It is imperative that we continue to invest the
resources required to support our customers' needs.''

Simtek Corporation delivers the world's fastest re-programmable
nonvolatile semiconductor memories and the industry's most
cost-effective FPGA to ASIC conversions. Information on Simtek
products can be obtained from its web page: www.simtek.com;

Broadcom; Broadcom to Team its Blutonium Chip with WIDCOMM's Bluetooth Soft=
ware for Windows   SAN DIEGO, Oct 29, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- WIDCOMM(R) In=
c., a leader in short-range wireless communications and Bluetooth networkin=
g, today announced an agreement with Broadcom Corporation (Nasdaq:BRCM), th=
e leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadband communications=
. The agreement allows Broadcom(R) to demonstrate and distribute WIDCOMM's =
BTW Bluetooth Communications Software for Windows(R) with Broadcom's Bluton=
ium(TM) chipsets.   Broadcom's Bluetooth customers will be able to evaluate=
 WIDCOMM's BTW protocol stack and the Broadcom BCM2033 single-chip solution=
 for Bluetooth wireless applications together. Broadcom will distribute an =
evaluation copy of WIDCOMM's BTW for customers interested in the combined s=
olution.   Broadcom's BCM2033 single chip solution consists of a Bluetooth =
v1.1 qualified radio and baseband integrated together to provide a high per=
formance, low power single chip solution. WIDCOMM's BTW provides an upper l=
ayer protocol stack, an extensive array of Bluetooth profiles, an integrate=

y BTW supports the Windows(R) 98SE, Windows(R) Me and Windows(R) 2000 platf=
orms; soon it will also support Windows(R) XP. The combined offering is a t=
urnkey Bluetooth solution for PC OEMs and is fully compliant with v.1.1 of =
the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) standard.   "We chose to distrib=
ute WIDCOMM's software because its BTW application works seamlessly with Br=
oadcom's Blutonium products to provide reliable, feature-rich Bluetooth app=
lications for the Windows environment," commented Scott Bibaud, Director of=
 Marketing for Broadcom's Bluetooth products. "Now customers will be able t=
o evaluate both premier products at the same time and be assured of strict =
compliance with Bluetooth's interoperability standards."   "WIDCOMM's BTW r=
unning on Broadcom's chipset gives Broadcom customers a complete solution t=
hat enables them to produce prototypes earlier and bring products to market=
 faster," said Ron Wong, WIDCOMM's Director of Marketing.   WIDCOMM's core =
Bluetooth protocol software is the world's first Bluetooth Qualification Bo=
dy (BQB)-certified product. Similarly, Broadcom's BCM2001, another product =
in the Blutonium family, was the world's first radio transceiver developed =
in a standard digital CMOS process to achieve BQB certification.   About WI=
DCOMM  WIDCOMM, Inc. ("Wireless Internet and Data/Voice Communications"), i=

Dear Andy,
 
Let me thank you for your time last Monday.
 
I never realized that the phone conversation lasted for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Indeed, it was a reconfirmation of what I have read and understood to be the Gas and Power Business. More than anything else, I have learned a lot from that conversation. I appreciate your thoughts on trading natural gas in particular, and your experiences at Enron, in general. 
 
To bigger volumes and larger revenues!
 
Sincerely,
Yvan

Commentary:

Todays price action was roll over day and anything can happen when converting to a new contract month. I am rushing to get this recap out, so todays commentary will be very brief.

We did get jobless claims numbers out and they were bearish up 13,000 much more than expected. This data was the largest gain in claims since 9/92'

When rolling contracts in our system it will always create a second trade in the same day. However todays move on the bullish side in the Sept contract has proven to be a very nice
move. As we write this Globex is at 1291.00 and the nasdaq is 2013 Sept. Intel came out with news that was on a positve note and its up 7% in the night market.


Until tomorrow.


For those of you who know me and we have spoken before. Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my (montra) about trading systems that are available to the retail public. Since I was
introduced to "SYSTEM TRADING" back in 1994.00 and have never looked back, I am more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success. However I
also feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program, and that if its going to have any real long term longevity to it, (then why would
anyone sell it?) The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is.

I found this section in the June edition of Futures magazine, go to page #52 in the middle of the page is a observation from them on tracking systems. And I quote "ALMOST ALL
SUCCESSFUL SYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT-TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS. (THE CONSISTENT SHORT-TERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED.) Un quote.
Well folks the fact is yes it has been developed, its just not for sale? I guess traders will just half to settle for being part of a managed acct with us that has shown to make money.


For those potential clients that are following us one very important aspect of our system is that it feeds on a great deal of data that is transmitted from the cash market. And both
technical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes.We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have
been violated regardless of where the futures are.

What most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity's and futures have there own (platforms) and there own (systems). Its been proven that as long
as one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year. Human
intervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of. It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did "today" but
whats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame. This is the secret for long term success.


On the E-mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8/21/2001 "Single Stock futures" This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be
one of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models. The large firms will
have access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12/21/2001. As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good.

For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all
computer based with there own trading programs.

Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues. For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a
contract. And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year. For more details on this market see details below.

CBOE Create Joint Venture on Single-Stock Futures World's Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For-Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited
Stake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001

 - The world's largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U.S. are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product - single-stock futures contracts. The
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single-stock futures, following
approval by the boards of directors of both exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake. Legislation signed
into law in December will allow the introduction of single-stock futures by U.S. financial exchanges later this year, after an 18-year prohibition on the products. "Today's
announcement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago's exchanges," said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky. "This exciting new
initiative combines the best of securities and futures trading. Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world's center in derivatives
trading and risk management." "The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for
single-stock futures," said CME Chairman Scott Gordon. "Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago
exchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products." "I am enthused that Chicago's exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers' needs
and our members' concerns," said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy. "We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide
great benefit to our members." "Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and
connectivity of the futures and securities worlds," said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty. "This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital
efficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options." "The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new
product to our markets," said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. "The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important
contributions to the success of this venture." The joint venture will be a for-profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated
exchange. Single-stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME's GLOBEX?2 electronic trading
system. CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products. McNulty
said the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC. The exchanges anticipate
contracting with Designated Primary Market-Makers (DPMs) in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,
selection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements. Single-stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and
corporate hedging activities. CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange-for-physicals (EFPs). The Chicago Board
Options Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982. Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40
indexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq-100, and the S&P 100. It remains the world's largest and most successful options
marketplace. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S&P 500 in 1982. Today, CME trades futures and futures options on
indexes including the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e-50? , S&P/BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E-mini
S&P 500 and E-mini Nasdaq-100 contracts - the fastest growing products in the exchange's history. CME also trades interest rate, foreign currency and agricultural commodity products.
On November 13, 2000, CME demutualized and became a for-profit, shareholder-owned corporation. CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CME is regulated by
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Additional information about the CBOE and CME can be found at their respective Web sites: www.cboe.com and www.cme.com.

CONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR TO AUTHORIZE SOMEONE ELSE TO TRADE FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:

IF YOU PURCHASE A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND OF ALL TRANSACTION COSTS.

IF YOU PURCHASE OR SELL A COMMODITY FUTURE OR SELL A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE INITIAL MARGIN FUNDS AND ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU DEPOSIT WITH YOUR
BROKER TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST YOUR POSITION, YOU MAY BE CALLED UPON BY YOUR BROKER TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN
FUNDS, ON SHORT NOTICE, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUIRED FUNDS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME, YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED AT A LOSS, AND YOU
WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING DEFICIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT.

UNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO LIQUIDATE A POSITION.  THIS CAN OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE MARKET MAKES A "LIMIT MOVE".  THE PLACEMENT OF
CONTINGENT ORDERS BY YOU OR YOUR TRADING ADVISOR, SUCH AS A "STOP-LOSS" OR "STOP-LIMIT" ORDER, WILL NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT YOUR LOSSES TO THE INTENDED AMOUNTS, SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS
MAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE SUCH ORDERS.

A "SPREAD" POSITION MAY NOT BE LESS RISKY THAN A SIMPLE "LONG" OR "SHORT" POSITION.  THE HIGH DEGREE OF LEVERAGE THAT IS OFTEN OBTAINABLE IN COMMODITY TRADING CAN WORK AGAINST YOU AS
WELL AS FOR YOU.  THE USE OF LEVERAGE CAN LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS.

IN SOME CASES, MANAGED COMMODITY ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY FEES.  IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES
TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFIT TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS.  THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS AT PAGE SEVEN A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH FEE TO BE CHARGED
TO YOUR ACCOUNT BY THE COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR.

THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE COMMODITY MARKETS.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND COMMODITY

INCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES MARKET MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION.  FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES
MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE YOUR TRANSACTIONS MAY BE EFFECTED.  BEFORE YOU TRADE
YOU SHOULD INQUIRE ABOUT ANY RULES RELEVANT TO YOUR PARTICULAR CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND ASK THE FIRM WITH WHICH YOU INTEND TO TRADE FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE TYPES OF REDRESS
AVAILABLE IN BOTH YOUR LOCAL AND OTHER RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS.
 
THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR IS PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ACCEPTING FUNDS IN THE TRADING ADVISOR'S NAME FROM A CLIENT FOR TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS.  YOU MUST PLACE ALL FUNDS FOR
TRADING IN THIS TRADING PROGRAM DIRECTLY WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT.

THE WEEK/George Bush's Emergency

from The American Spectator:

"Stock market crashes predict recessions rather than cause them. But when
the driving force of the economy is exceptionally rapid innovation powered
by risk capital, the disappearance in less than a year of $5 trillion
worth of such capital, largely as a result of a Federal Reserve sucker
punch, must be treated by the government as an emergency.

"Even in much of the financial press, the most common reaction to the
Nasdaq collapse has been sniggering self-satisfaction that go-go investors
have finally gotten theirs. All one needed to do to avoid disaster,
high-risk investors are condescendingly told, was to be a sensible fellow
and invest in the Real Economy, where they make important things, like
Coke or perhaps aluminum-for the cans.

"But the 'value' investor snuggled safely on the sidelines is
comparatively useless to economic growth. Growth is primarily a function
of innovation, and thus of risk. Investors in innovation, against all
conventional wisdom, bet that they can beat the market, defying its
relentless "efficiency" to seek out as yet unrecognized and undiscounted
advance.

"This is at the best of times a hazardous undertaking. In the early 1970s,
risk capital essentially disappeared, intimidated by a combination of
inflation, high taxes and government hostility. The 20-year boom has
largely been driven by the restoration of risk capital's rewards.

"The Fed's whipsawing of investors over the past 18 months shattered those
rewards, discouraging and de-funding the nation's most useful investors.
The administration could hardly do anything more useful than create
incentives to get them back in the game. It was the capital gains tax cuts
of 1978, 1981 and 1997 that most powerfully drove the boom. For those
obsessed with surpluses, capital gains cuts //always// pay for themselves.

"Cutting the current 20 percent rate by five points and narrowing or
ending the distinction between long- and short-term gains would do more to
resurrect the Nasdaq than the Fed's rate-cut water torture. And it would
do more than all the one-sided bipartisanship and compassionate
conservatism in the world to secure the administration's increasingly
tenuous political future."

The May issue of The American Spectator--"The Current Emergency, The
Coming Boom"--rolls out an all-star lineup of economic fire-breathers,
including Rich Karlgaard, Larry Kudlow, Arthur Laffer, Alan Reynolds and
Brian Wesbury, plus someone named George Gilder. Ask for it at your

FROM DYNAMIC SILICON/Optical MEMS

"Microelectromechanical system-based components will invade the optical
network, in photonic switches, simple switches, add/drop multiplexers,
variable attenuators, and adaptive equalizers. They will be smaller than
macro-scale equivalents because they are fabricated with semiconductor
processes rather than with macro-scale machining. They will be cheaper
because they are batch fabricated by the tens of thousands in
semiconductor foundries. They will be more efficient because they are
smaller, have less mass, move smaller distances in tuning, and are on a
scale comparable to the wavelengths being manipulated. There's a
compelling case for removing electrical signal conversions in the network
core. There's equally compelling logic for the invasion of MEMS throughout
the optical network"

The April issue of Dynamic Silicon, by Nick Tredennick and Brian
Shimamoto, is online now. Subscribers can log in
at.www.DynamicSilicon.com.

FRIDAY FEATURE/Shock Horror: Tax Cuts Spur Entrepreneurs!

MIT's Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Solow likes to crack
(apparently un-ironically) that economic theory advances one academic
funeral at a time. That goes triply for anything that smacks of -dare we
say it?-the supply side. But hope, like growth,. springs eternal. In a new
monograph titled "Personal Income Taxes and the Growth of Small Firms", a
team of unimpeachably mainstream economists headed by Princeton's Harvey
Rosen used tax return data to determine how reductions in marginal tax
rates (in this case, the 1986 Tax Reform Act) affect small businesses. No
prize for guessing what they found: "The greater the decrease in the sole
proprietor's marginal tax rates," the report concludes, "the greater the
increase in the size of his or her business."

Note that we're talking revenue growth here, not just a post-tax earnings
boost. And the results are startling, even after controlling for
everything from the entrepreneurs' personal profiles to the industries in
which they operate: cutting the top marginal rate from 50 percent to 33
percent increased the size of the average business by 28 percent.

That's not trivial in macro terms either. In 1985, non-farm sole
proprietors accounted for roughly 20 percent of the $2.8 trillion in US
domestic business income. Now maybe the same team can go back to the same
data and look at the effects on tax receipts!

STOREWIDTH 2001/The Movie

We're still hearing raves for Storewidth 2001, wherein the newest link in
the Gilder paradigm had its coming-out party among the industry's best and
brightest. From EMC and Net App to Yotta Yotta. Yipes and BlueArc, more
than 400 storage and networking executives, engineers, VCs and fund
managers converged April 10-12 at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel, to hear
what happens when exploding data-storage capabilities collide with the
Net's bandwidth tsunami. Slowdown? Not!

But this time we're not just talkin' the talk. Through May 15th, the
original live Webcast of Storewidth 2001 is available online. A $50
processing charge allows unlimited access to two and a half days of
bleeding-edge presentations, strong opinions and onstage pyrotechnics,
streamed as fast as your system can take it. Call 1-800-261-5307 to order
a password.

WATCH THIS SPACE/Gilder.com

A lot of you know about www.Gildertech.com, digital home of the Gilder
Technology Report and our busiest online outlet. We've also got
www.DigitalPowerReport.com, www.DynamicSilicon.com,
www.NewEconomyWatch.com, www.GilderConferences.com, and now
www.Spectator.org-enough of a handful for us to think seriously about how
to tie it all together.

The answer we've come up with is www.Gilder.com, an umbrella for both the
full range of what we're doing and for the big ideas we focus on in
technology, politics and investing. Gilder.com doesn't replace the other
sites; it gives them breadth, depth and context. The Friday Letter is a
part of this. So are the rest of the new features we'll be rolling out
over the coming months. One of those, a live interactive poll, launched
this week, asking whether the economy-and markets-may already have
bottomed out . We'd like to hear your ideas about other assets and tools
you'd like. Check in and check it out.

UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

No Bonds today


Commentary:

Todays price action was the true meaning of "Murphys Law". On the open the NYSE "KNEW" that the new software that they installed last night was not working properly. The Market was
closed down after aprox fifthteen min of the open of the bell. The software issue prevented about 30% of the Dow stocks from trasmittng from the exchange to the retail public.(However
the big players on the floor were able to still trade for a short time?) This move by the board members created a shut down of aprox 59 minutes. When this market failed, the Merc
followed after the futures moved 10pts to the down side after the fact. The Nasdaq was still open both N.Y. and Chicago.

What was very interesting the Bonds did not react to this fundamental news in anyway. The real sell off that took place all day was more follow through from negative earnings news on
"Jupiner" and also that the British pound got hit hard in London last night. We saw the market except for a bit of short covering the last 30 min of the cash market just make lower
lows and lower highs. The volume was reported as the lightest all year at the NYSE.

Where do we go from here? The wave traders are now looking to the fact that we did not see 1293.00 to 1298.00 today as a bearish pull back, and the potential of seeing 1255.00 "may"
set up some time next week. We "think" from the fact that our system did get us short and there was no sign of any real recovery all day from the fall out in N.Y. that the trend is
down. We also"think" the bias of negitave fundamental news thats starting to come out is going to have a much broader impact on the market than these short bursts of bullish activity
for a few days. "If" we can take out 1265.00 on Globex Sunday night then this will send a real strong message for the open Mon. The activity in London will set the first tone with
there currency issues and Globex and the bonds will follow.

Until Monday.



For those of you who know me and we have spoken before. Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my (montra) about trading systems that are available to the retail public. Since I was
introduced to "SYSTEM TRADING" back in 1994.00 and have never looked back, I am more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success. However I
also feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program, and that if its going to have any real long term longevity to it, (then why would
anyone sell it?) The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is.

I found this section in the June edition of Futures magazine, go to page #52 in the middle of the page is a observation from them on tracking systems. And I quote "ALMOST ALL
SUCCESSFUL SYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT-TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS. (THE CONSISTENT SHORT-TERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED.) Un quote.
Well folks the fact is yes it has been developed, its just not for sale? I guess traders will just half to settle for being part of a managed acct with us that has shown to make money.


For those potential clients that are following us one very important aspect of our system is that it feeds on a great deal of data that is transmitted from the cash market. And both
technical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes.We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have
been violated regardless of where the futures are.

What most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity's and futures have there own (platforms) and there own (systems). Its been proven that as long
as one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year. Human
intervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of. It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did "today" but
whats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame. This is the secret for long term success.


On the E-mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8/21/2001 "Single Stock futures" This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be
one of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models. The large firms will
have access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12/21/2001. As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good.

For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all
computer based with there own trading programs.

Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues. For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a
contract. And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year. For more details on this market see details below.

CBOE Create Joint Venture on Single-Stock Futures World's Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For-Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited
Stake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001

 - The world's largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U.S. are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product - single-stock futures contracts. The
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single-stock futures, following
approval by the boards of directors of both exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake. Legislation signed
into law in December will allow the introduction of single-stock futures by U.S. financial exchanges later this year, after an 18-year prohibition on the products. "Today's
announcement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago's exchanges," said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky. "This exciting new
initiative combines the best of securities and futures trading. Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world's center in derivatives
trading and risk management." "The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for
single-stock futures," said CME Chairman Scott Gordon. "Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago
exchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products." "I am enthused that Chicago's exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers' needs
and our members' concerns," said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy. "We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide
great benefit to our members." "Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and
connectivity of the futures and securities worlds," said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty. "This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital
efficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options." "The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new
product to our markets," said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. "The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important
contributions to the success of this venture." The joint venture will be a for-profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated
exchange. Single-stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME's GLOBEX?2 electronic trading
system. CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products. McNulty
said the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC. The exchanges anticipate
contracting with Designated Primary Market-Makers (DPMs) in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,
selection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements. Single-stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and
corporate hedging activities. CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange-for-physicals (EFPs). The Chicago Board
Options Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982. Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40
indexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq-100, and the S&P 100. It remains the world's largest and most successful options
marketplace. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S&P 500 in 1982. Today, CME trades futures and futures options on
indexes including the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e-50? , S&P/BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E-mini
S&P 500 and E-mini Nasdaq-100 contracts - the fastest growing products in the exchange's history. CME also trades interest rate, foreign currency and agricultural commodity products.
On November 13, 2000, CME demutualized and became a for-profit, shareholder-owned corporation. CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CME is regulated by
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Additional information about the CBOE and CME can be found at their respective Web sites: www.cboe.com and www.cme.com.

No Bonds today


Commentary:

Todays price action was the true meaning of "Murphys Law". On the open the NYSE "KNEW" that the new software that they installed last night was not working properly. The Market was
closed down after aprox fifthteen min of the open of the bell. The software issue prevented about 30% of the Dow stocks from trasmittng from the exchange to the retail public.(However
the big players on the floor were able to still trade for a short time?) This move by the board members created a shut down of aprox 59 minutes. When this market failed, the Merc
followed after the futures moved 10pts to the down side after the fact. The Nasdaq was still open both N.Y. and Chicago.

What was very interesting the Bonds did not react to this fundamental news in anyway. The real sell off that took place all day was more follow through from negative earnings news on
"Jupiner" and also that the British pound got hit hard in London last night. We saw the market except for a bit of short covering the last 30 min of the cash market just make lower
lows and lower highs. The volume was reported as the lightest all year at the NYSE.

Where do we go from here? The wave traders are now looking to the fact that we did not see 1293.00 to 1298.00 today as a bearish pull back, and the potential of seeing 1255.00 "may"
set up some time next week. We "think" from the fact that our system did get us short and there was no sign of any real recovery all day from the fall out in N.Y. that the trend is
down. We also"think" the bias of negitave fundamental news thats starting to come out is going to have a much broader impact on the market than these short bursts of bullish activity
for a few days. "If" we can take out 1265.00 on Globex Sunday night then this will send a real strong message for the open Mon. The activity in London will set the first tone with
there currency issues and Globex and the bonds will follow.

Until Monday.



For those of you who know me and we have spoken before. Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my (montra) about trading systems that are available to the retail public. Since I was
introduced to "SYSTEM TRADING" back in 1994.00 and have never looked back, I am more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success. However I
also feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program, and that if its going to have any real long term longevity to it, (then why would
anyone sell it?) The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is.

I found this section in the June edition of Futures magazine, go to page #52 in the middle of the page is a observation from them on tracking systems. And I quote "ALMOST ALL
SUCCESSFUL SYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT-TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS. (THE CONSISTENT SHORT-TERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED.) Un quote.
Well folks the fact is yes it has been developed, its just not for sale? I guess traders will just half to settle for being part of a managed acct with us that has shown to make money.


For those potential clients that are following us one very important aspect of our system is that it feeds on a great deal of data that is transmitted from the cash market. And both
technical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes.We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have
been violated regardless of where the futures are.

What most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity's and futures have there own (platforms) and there own (systems). Its been proven that as long
as one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year. Human
intervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of. It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did "today" but
whats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame. This is the secret for long term success.


On the E-mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8/21/2001 "Single Stock futures" This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be
one of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models. The large firms will
have access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12/21/2001. As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good.

For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all
computer based with there own trading programs.

Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues. For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a
contract. And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year. For more details on this market see details below.

CBOE Create Joint Venture on Single-Stock Futures World's Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For-Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited
Stake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001

 - The world's largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U.S. are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product - single-stock futures contracts. The
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single-stock futures, following
approval by the boards of directors of both exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake. Legislation signed
into law in December will allow the introduction of single-stock futures by U.S. financial exchanges later this year, after an 18-year prohibition on the products. "Today's

contributions to the success of this venture." The joint venture will be a for-profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated
exchange. Single-stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME's GLOBEX?2 electronic trading
system. CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products. McNulty
said the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC. The exchanges anticipate
contracting with Designated Primary Market-Makers (DPMs) in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,
selection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements. Single-stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and
corporate hedging activities. CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange-for-physicals (EFPs). The Chicago Board
Options Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982. Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40
indexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq-100, and the S&P 100. It remains the world's largest and most successful options
marketplace. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S&P 500 in 1982. Today, CME trades futures and futures options on
indexes including the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e-50? , S&P/BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E-mini
S&P 500 and E-mini Nasdaq-100 contracts - the fastest growing products in the exchange's history. CME also trades interest rate, foreign currency and agricultural commodity products.
On November 13, 2000, CME demutualized and became a for-profit, shareholder-owned corporation. CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CME is regulated by
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Additional information about the CBOE and CME can be found at their respective Web sites: www.cboe.com and www.cme.com.

RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

THE RISK OF LOSS IN TRADING COMMODITIES CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IN
CONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR TO AUTHORIZE SOMEONE ELSE TO TRADE FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:

IF YOU PURCHASE A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND OF ALL TRANSACTION COSTS.

IF YOU PURCHASE OR SELL A COMMODITY FUTURE OR SELL A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE INITIAL MARGIN FUNDS AND ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU DEPOSIT WITH YOUR
BROKER TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST YOUR POSITION, YOU MAY BE CALLED UPON BY YOUR BROKER TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN
FUNDS, ON SHORT NOTICE, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION.  IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUIRED FUNDS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME, YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED AT A LOSS, AND YOU
WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING DEFICIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT.

UNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO LIQUIDATE A POSITION.  THIS CAN OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE MARKET MAKES A "LIMIT MOVE".  THE PLACEMENT OF
CONTINGENT ORDERS BY YOU OR YOUR TRADING ADVISOR, SUCH AS A "STOP-LOSS" OR "STOP-LIMIT" ORDER, WILL NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT YOUR LOSSES TO THE INTENDED AMOUNTS, SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS
MAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE SUCH ORDERS.

A "SPREAD" POSITION MAY NOT BE LESS RISKY THAN A SIMPLE "LONG" OR "SHORT" POSITION.  THE HIGH DEGREE OF LEVERAGE THAT IS OFTEN OBTAINABLE IN COMMODITY TRADING CAN WORK AGAINST YOU AS
WELL AS FOR YOU.  THE USE OF LEVERAGE CAN LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS.

IN SOME CASES, MANAGED COMMODITY ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY FEES.  IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES
TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFIT TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS.  THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS AT PAGE SEVEN A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH FEE TO BE CHARGED
TO YOUR ACCOUNT BY THE COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR.

THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE COMMODITY MARKETS.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND COMMODITY
TRADING BEFORE YOU TRADE, INCLUDING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT AT PAGE FIVE.
 
YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR MAY ENGAGE IN TRADING FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS.  TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
INCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES MARKET MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION.  FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES
MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE YOUR TRANSACTIONS MAY BE EFFECTED.  BEFORE YOU TRADE
YOU SHOULD INQUIRE ABOUT ANY RULES RELEVANT TO YOUR PARTICULAR CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND ASK THE FIRM WITH WHICH YOU INTEND TO TRADE FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE TYPES OF REDRESS
AVAILABLE IN BOTH YOUR LOCAL AND OTHER RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS.

THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR IS PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ACCEPTING FUNDS IN THE TRADING ADVISOR'S NAME FROM A CLIENT FOR TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS.  YOU MUST PLACE ALL FUNDS FOR
TRADING IN THIS TRADING PROGRAM DIRECTLY WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT.
