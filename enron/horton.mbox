Congrats!  Great job. And my team certainly appreciates all the great help on the teaser. We have several CAs signed up with a few outstanding issues on a few more so being able to distribute on Monday will be helpful.  Mark

The Indian Mesa sale closed last night in NY.  Our team did a great job.  All we have to do now is convince Enron's creditor's committee to let us use the net proceeds through a sale of the wind company!  

Regarding the sale, we are wrapping up today the revised '01 numbers and the '02 and '03 projections and expect we will have the teaser done for a Monday distribution as planned.  Happy New Year.  Adam

We are planning on the following schedule for the upcoming business review in Omaha.  The goal of the meeting is to encourage discussion about the focus and direction of each of Northern's Marketing teams rather than simply presenting material.  With this in mind we are planning to have smaller meetings and divide the discussion in to four sessions.   In additon to Stan, Dan, Rod (if available) and myself, we will have only those people listed below at each session. 


10:00 - 11:15   - Topic:  Power, Business Development and Acquisitions (plus long term South End Strategy)
                                - Participants:   John Dushinske, Mike Stage, Chuck Wilkinson, Mike McGowan, Shelly Corman

11:15 - 12:00   - Topic:  LDC Accounts and relationships
                                - Participants:  Bill Fowler, Frank Semin, Bob Stevens

12:00 -   1:00 	- Topic:  Overall Commercial / Regulatory Strategy (SLA, 637, Rate Case)
                                - Participants - Mary Kay Miller, Steve Kirk, Kent MIller, Drew Fossum, Shelly Corman

1:00 - 2:00        - Topic:  Storage, Pricing & Structuring, Risk Management
                                - Participants:  Kent Miller, Jo Williams, Sue Neville,  Lee Ferrell

We will follow up with a more detailed outline prior to the meeting.  Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

Thanks,

Dave

Per discussions with Steve Harris we have re-estimated volumes and costs for a smaller version of Project Red Rock. We have studied two scenarios and the results are as follows.
 
70 mmcf/d Case
                           Requires PGT-25 compressor installation at TW Stations No.1 and No.2.
                           Estimated cost = $48,000,000
 
120 mmcf/d Case
                           Requires PGT-25 Compressor installation at TW Stations No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3.
                           Estimated cost = $72,000,000.



GE has informed us that absent a substantial commitment from Enron by June 13, they will be forced to stop all work on the 4 PGT-25 compressor packages for Project Red Rock.  If we elect to restart this work at a later date, the original delivery dates (Nov-Dec 2001) will not be feasible.
 
We have proposed to GE that Enron make an irrevocable commitment for 2 or 3 PGT-25 Compressors by June 13, and GE continue to preserve the original delivery dates for the uncommitted balance.  They have indicated that this will be an acceptable arrangement through the end of June.  With no further commitment from Enron for the balance of the original order by June 30, GE would stop all work on the uncommitted portion of the order.
 
This would preserve our required In-Service date for 150 mmcf/d through the end of June, and of course, would preserve the required In-Service date for a reduced Project Red Rock.
 
If, by the end of June we have not committed to the balance of the compressor order, I believe that we may be able to scale back the purchase of the uncommitted PGT-25 Compressors packages.
 
The PGT-25 Compressor package consists of a Gas Generator (LM 2500) and a skid mounted Gas Compressor/Power Turbine.   The reason for long manufacturing lead-time is the Gas Compressor/Power Turbine.  We may be able to purchase the PGT-25 Compressor package without an LM-2500 Gas Generator.  LM-2500 Gas Generators are much easier to come by on short notice.  The cost of the Gas Compressor/Power Turbine, without an LM 2500 Gas Generator, is about $4,000,000.  The cost of the LM 2500 Gas Generator is about $5,500,000.  We have not discussed this with GE at this time but I believe it is feasible to preserve project delivery options.
 
We are preparing a communication to send to GE affirming our election to make an irrevocable commitment on some portion of the original order.  We will release that communication to GE next week if you wish to proceed on either of these alternatives.   I will not be in the office this coming Monday but Jerry will be available to followup.

Ray:   Will do.
   
Mike and Dave:   I know these are trying times but we still do have to follow the rules.   If you have questions about financial/cash/treasury issues please contact myself or Kevin Howard or the Corporate Treasury folks and we will get you an answer or get your request moved along the proper channels as necessary.

Rod,
 
Please remind the Enron Wind folks that all accounts should be set up in coordination with the Treasury group.  Clearly, much of the proceeds here will not be comingled with Enron funds, but we still need to adhere to Enron's board policy.  Thanks.

Ray, 
I understand that Enron Wind opened an account on their own to hold the proceeds of the sale of Indian Mesa and Clear Sky.  Enron was not involved in this opening.  I'd like to open an account and move funds into compliance.  Do you agree?

PIPELINE NOTES FROM WASHINGTON
Vol. 4, No. 51
December 28, 2001

Association of Oil Pipe Lines
(202) 408-7970
(202) 408-7983 (fax)
bcooper@aopl.org

The opinions if any expressed in these notes are the author's only and do
not represent the views of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines (but they
should).


1.	OPS Inspection Protocols for Integrity Management Revised and Published

The Inspection Protocols to be used for the Office of Pipeline Safety's
Segment Identification and Completeness Check Inspections have been revised
to reflect experience gained in the pilot tests.  These are available for
viewing and downloading from the following location:
http://primis.rspa.dot.gov/iim/protocol.htm.   These inspections will be
conducted in the first quarter of 2002 for operators who own or operate 500
or more miles of hazardous liquid pipeline.  The primary objective of these
inspections is to determine operator compliance with the requirement to
identify all pipeline segments that can affect High Consequence Areas by
December 31, 2001.  OPS will also conduct a completeness check to ascertain
the status of the operator's progress in developing the Integrity Management
Program Elements required by the new rule (49 CFR 195.452).  The protocols
provide the basic questions to be used in performing these inspections and
the framework under which more detailed lines of inquiry may be conducted.

2.	House Pipeline Safety Legislation

H.R. 3609, the House pipeline safety bill introduced December 20, is not up
on the Library of Congress website: http://thomas.loc.gov, but highlights
from the table of contents to give you a sense of the bill's provisions:
Sec. 2 strengthens the federal one call notification law passed two
Congresses ago and gives a big boost to the Common Ground Alliance;
Sec. 3 strengthens federal enforcement of one-call requirements;
Sec. 4 requires each pipeline operator to have a public safety program;
Sec. 5 authorizes the Secretary to require operators to take corrective
action to address potentially unsafe conditions or vulnerabilities to
terrorist attacks;
Sec. 6 increases civil penalties under the Pipeline Safety Act,;
Sec. 7 strikes the word "demonstration" where it is used in connection with
risk management;
Sec. 8 provides for a federal study of land use practices and zoning
ordinances with regard to pipeline rights-of-way;
Sec. 9 establishes a program of pipeline integrity research, development and
demonstration;
Sec. 10 requires each pipeline operator to have a program to qualify
pipeline controllers that is certified by the Secretary of Transportation;
Sec. 11 directs the Secretary to require each pipeline operator to have a
terrorism security program;
Sec. 12 makes participation in the National Pipeline Mapping System a
statutory requirement;
Sec. 13 provides for the expediting of permit review by federal agencies for
pipeline repair and rehabilitation projects;
Sec. 14 protects sensitive information about pipeline vulnerabilities from
disclosure;
Sec. 15 makes technical changes; and
Sec. 16 authorizes funding for the Office of Pipeline Safety for four years.

	Under the AOPL/API Environmental and Safety Initiative, the Integrity and
Reauthorization Team, captained by ChevronTexaco's Jeet Bindra, will develop
the oil pipeline industry's response to this bill.  If you are interested in
working with this team, let us know.

3.	Fiscal Year 2002 Fees

The fees to be assessed for natural gas transmission, hazardous liquid and
liquefied natural gas (LNG) are: natural gas transmission pipelines: $109.15
per mile (based on 298,132 miles of pipeline); and hazardous liquid
pipelines: $121.99 per mile (based on 160,546 miles of pipeline).  LNG is
based on the number of plants and total storage capacity of each plant.  The

The Indian Mesa sale closed last night in NY.  Our team did a great job.  All we have to do now is convince Enron's creditor's committee to let us use the net proceeds through a sale of the wind company!  

Regarding the sale, we are wrapping up today the revised '01 numbers and the '02 and '03 projections and expect we will have the teaser done for a Monday distribution as planned.  Happy New Year.  Adam

Definitions:
Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport and storage agreements or unhedged natural positions.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.

Here are the bullets for your discussion w/ Kevin regarding EBS interest in service from EAMR.




	EAMR/EBS OPPORTUNITIES

?	Asset Management Services provided by EAMR will generate costs savings for EBS.

?	EBS assets under consideration -    Cable Duct and ROW
Signal Amplification Re-gen facilities (located    approximately 50 mile intervals)
Customer Terminal locations ( Buildings, HVAC  Maintenance)
					      POP's  "Point of Presence" ( Electronic Switching)

?	Services to be provided    Operations/Maintenance
          Fleet Management
				          Material Management
				          Safety
		                     Technical Services
			         Environmental
			         ROW
		                     Communications
			        Computerized Maintenance Management System
			        Crisis Management/Emergency Response
			        Damage Prevention

?	Preliminary estimate of cost savings at approximately $2 million annually.  EAMR would propose to share those savings with EBS.

?	EAMR would absorb some of the existing EBS operations employees that are necessary to achieve required skill levels for EBS facilities. Approximately 40% of EBS ROW is in proximity to pipeline assets.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Folks -- 

Had a good discussion with a Senior Staff member at FERC in preparation for the Pipelines Outreach meeting next week.  He told me that the two issues on the gas side that are of primary concern to the Commission are 1) Marketing Affiliates and potential abuse on the pipelines (Think El Paso); and 2) the failure of CFTC and/or SEC to more closely oversee derivative trading. 

Apparently, staff is considering whether to ban all transactions by marketers on an affiliated pipeline, and some form of filing/reporting requirement to better understand the derivative market.  Due to a lack of information, some at FERC are assuming the worst.    

I believe these proposals are in the formative stage and have not been presented to Senior Staff or Commissioners as a recommendation.  I think Staff would appreciate some information (ammo) to refute the need to further regulate marketing affiliates or delve into derivative trading.

INGAA filed comments and a study concerning Marketers' use of affiliated pipelines in response to the Marketing Affiliate Conference at FERC.  These are attached.   Staff questions whether the underlying information remains accurate.  We are considering whether to update the underlying information used in the INGAA Study and how best to address these issues (probably during Q&As) during the Staff Outreach.

I believe it would be helpful to put back together the coalition that Leslie Lawner used at the last Market Affiliate conference to request a meeting as part of the current Staff Outreach to discuss Staff's concerns.  In addition, I think it would be helpful to request a separate ENRON meeting with Staff to discuss how the derivative market works and why FERC does not need to establish ongoing reporting requirements or otherwise become involved in these markets.  Unfortunately, in this meeting we would probably be asked about our involvement in the El Paso Merchant Transportation deal into California, in light of Peggy Hegg's comment on the Frontline Show that El Paso hedged some of the risk with Enron.  

We can discuss further on Friday's call.  Later Joe

PIPELINE NOTES FROM WASHINGTON
Vol. 4, No. 22
June 8, 2001

Association of Oil Pipe Lines
(202) 408-7970
(202) 408-7983 (fax)
bcooper@aopl.org

The opinions if any expressed in these notes are the author's only and do
not represent the views of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines (but they
should).


1.	Commission Schedules Colonial Market-Based Rate Renewal Request

	At its June 13 meeting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission intends to
take up Colonial's request to renew its market-based rates into the
Northeast markets.  In the mid-90's, Colonial was granted market-based rate
status on movements from the Gulf Coast and from Philadelphia and New York
City area origins into Philadelphia and New York City area destinations, on
a temporary basis subject to renewal.  In March 2000, Colonial applied for
renewal.  No one objected, but the Commission has not acted on the matter.
Next week they promise to take it up.  You can view Colonial's application
at http://rimsweb1.ferc.fed.us/rims under docket number OR00-3-000.

2.	Commission Reaffirms Colonial Abandonment and New Service Ruling

	At its last meeting, the Commission approved an Order on Rehearing of the
Commission's October 27, 1999 order granting Colonial's petition for a
declaratory order on abandonment of existing service to Tennessee and the
rate structure of new service to Tennessee. (see 89 FERC  61,095 (1999)).
Exxon Mobil and Motiva had asked the Commission to reconsider that ruling.
	Colonial is building a new line from Birmingham, Alabama to Nashville via
Huntsville, Tennessee.  When that line is completed, it intends to abandon
service to Nashville via a line running from Atlanta.  Colonial sought a
ruling from the Commission that its abandonment of the Atlanta to Nashville
line will not be subject to challenge, that its indexed rates from Houston
origins to Birmingham will not be subject to challenge because of the new
connection, and that a cost-of-service may be used to establish the initial
rate for the service to Nashville and Huntsville via the new pipeline.  The
Commission approved all of the requests subject to verification at the time
that the change takes place.
	Exxon Mobil and Motiva argued that the rules for setting rates as a new
service should not apply to this situation because Colonial is really merely
providing a new route for an existing service.  The Commission disagreed,
finding that rates apply to the specific route and that this was a new
route.  Exxon Mobil and Motiva also argued that Colonial should not be able
to rely on indexed/grandfathered rates to Birmingham and to charge
cost-of-service rates for the new pipeline from Birmingham to the Tennessee
destinations.  They argued this was permitting the pipeline to mix and match
rate methodologies.  The Commission disagreed, stating that Colonial was
merely seeking to add a new service, which under the Commission's rules must
be justified either with a negotiated rate or on a cost-of-service basis.
Finally, Exxon Mobil argued that the Commission should look more closely at
the abandonment to determine whether the cancellation is in the public
interest under section 15(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act.  The Commission
found that complete abandonment of a service is outside its jurisdiction,
but allowed Exxon Mobil to argue at the time of the abandonment that a
complete abandonment would not take place.  A copy of the Commission's order
may be found at http://cips.ferc.fed.us/cips/default.htm under docket number
OR99-16-000.

3.	NTSB Issues Report on Marathon Ashland Spill

	The National Transportation Safety Board last week issued its accident
report on the Marathon Ashland spill in Kentucky last January.  According to
the report, that 11,644 barrel spill resulted from metal fatigue at a dent
site.  The line had been pigged in 1997 and an anomaly had been detected
there but the pig contractor had determined that the dent was not
significant.  It did not meet repair criteria used at the time.  The NTSB
found "failure of the controller and supervisors to timely recognize the
rupture, shut down the pipeline, and isolate the ruptured section of the
pipeline" contributed to the severity of the accident.  To review the report
yourself, go to http://www.ntsb.gov/Publictn/2001/PAB0102.htm.  To read what
the local paper had to say, go to
http://enquirer.com/editions/2001/06/02/loc_pipe_workers_are.html, Pipe,
workers are faulted in pipeline spill.

4.	Nomination for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

President Bush intends to nominate Michael Parker to be Assistant Secretary
of the Army for Civil Works.  Parker is a former Congressman from the 4th
District of  Mississippi serving from 1989 to 1999.  He was a member of  the
Budget,  Appropriations, Transportation, Education and Workforce and
Veteran's Affairs Committees.  His nomination must be approved by the
Senate.  The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, chaired by Sen.
Jeffords (I-VT), will consider the nomination.   Parker was elected as a
Democrat to the House of Representatives in 1989, and soon after the House
majority became Republican in 1994, Parker also became a Republican.  Parker
is currently the President and Owner of Parker-Malvaney Consulting, Inc., a
government affairs consulting firm in Brookhaven, Mississippi.

5.	Patty Murray (D-WA) on Bellingham Accident Anniversary

	Check the Congressional RECORD for June 7 at page S5959.
http://thomas.loc.gov/r107/r107.html  TWO-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE BELLINGHAM
WASHINGTON PIPELINE EXPLOSION.  Sen. Murray's press release is at
http://www.senate.gov/~murray/releases/01/06/2001607D05.html.

6.	New Lawsuits from the Bellingham Accident

http://news.bellinghamherald.com/stories/20010606/LocalState/55677.shtml --
4 sue Olympic for emotional suffering; Other defendants named include those
from prior pipeline suits.

7.	FERC Announces New Web Site

	The FERC has developed a new website including a new URL (www.ferc.gov)
designed to be more user friendly and organized "in a more intuitive manner"
than the old site.  Take a look at it and let us know what you think.

8.	Commissioner Wood Sworn In

	After confirmation by the Senate, it takes a few days for the nominees to
wrap up work at their former jobs. FERC Commissioner Pat Wood this week
finished his work at the Texas Public Utility Commission, where he was
chair, was sworn in on Tuesday and is in his office at the FERC.  One of his
first tasks will be to travel to California to meet with Governor Gray Davis
about the crisis in that state.  Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell may not
come on board until July.  Rumor has it that she will qualify for an
improved pension if she stays on in Pennsylvania for another month.

9.	Lois Epstein Changes Jobs and Job Locations

Lois Epstein, Environmental Defense's pipeline safety advocate, has left
Washington DC and Environmental Defense for Anchorage, Alaska.   There she
will work for a watershed-protection organization called Cook Inlet Keeper
"advocating for best possible performance for pipelines, refineries, and
other oil and gas infrastructure and working to prevent new oil and gas
drilling in sensitive portions of the watershed."  This leaves the pipeline
safety issue in DC to Jeremiah Baumann of US Public Interest Research Group,
Patricio Silva of the Natural Resources Defense Council and Paul Orum of the
Working Group on Community Right-to-Know.  There is still a possibility that
Environmental Defense will assign some new DC person to work on pipeline
safety issues.  Ms. Epstein hopes to continue as a public member of the
Office of Pipeline Safety's Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety
Advisory Committee.  For more on her new job, see www.inletkeeper.org.

10.	Exxon Prevails in Louisiana Expropriation Case

	We thought we had already reported to you on this one but can't find it in
back issues, and want to be sure you know.  Exxon recently prevailed in the
Supreme Court of Louisiana in a case involving valuation of pipeline
right-of-way in expropriation cases.  The landowners argued that the
appropriate measure of value for the expropriated land should be for the
highest and best use of the property as a pipeline corridor, and to
determine the value by looking at what other pipeline companies paid for
similar rights-of-way on a per rod basis.  Exxon argued that the appropriate
valuation method was using property comparables on a per acre basis.  The
difference in the two methods in this case was $ 251,505 versus $ 17,172.
The lower courts sided with the landowner but the Supreme Court agreed with
Exxon.  The opinion, Exxon Pipeline Company v. Hill, et al. can be accessed
on the court's web site at www.lasc.org.  Once you reach the site, go to the
May 15th press release to find the opinion.

11.	OPS Authorizes Reopening of Chalk Point Pipeline

	This is the pipeline that runs to the power plant just north of Washington,
DC that experienced a spill into a local wetlands last year, now rumored to
be the most expensive pipeline spill ever. The line was owned by Potomac
Electric Power Company.   The Office of Pipeline Safety has proposed a civil
fine of $ 674,000, and PEPCO claims the clean up has cost it more than $ 60
million.  The line and the power plant have now been sold to Mirant
Mid-Atlantic LLC.  OPS this week authorized Mirant to start the line back
up.  The OPS release can be found at
http://www.dot.gov/affairs/rspa1601.htm.   For the local view see
http://washingtonpost.com:80/wp-dyn/articles/A26573-2001Jun5.html, Closed
Oil Pipeline Slated for Reopening.

12.	Senate Commerce Subcommittee Chairmanships under the Democrats

The Democrats organized the Senate this week.  In the Coimmerce, Science and
Transportation Committee, Sen. Fritz Hollings (D-SC) became Committee
Chairman, and the subcommittees got new chairmen.   Sen. John Breaux (D-LA)
has the important one for us.  The lineup is as follows:
Aviation: Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV); Communications: Sen. Daniel Inouye
(D-HI);  Consumer Affairs, Foreign Commerce and Tourism: Sen. Byron Dorgan
(D-ND); Oceans & Fisheries: Sen. John Kerry (D-MA); Science, Space &
Technology: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR); and Surface Transportation and Merchant
Marine: Sen. John Breaux (D-LA).

13.	Pipeline Safety R&D at the Department of Energy

Following is a link to the Department of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy
and a recent announcement of several join government/industry projects to
develop high-tech ways to improve the safety and performance of the nation's
natural gas delivery system.
http://www.fe.doe.gov/techline/tl_gasinfra_sel1.shtml.

14.	Transportation Facility Siting

Pipeline permitting problems are just a subset of the permitting problems of

Thanks for your note.  Agreed that execution on IMI and II (construction, debt and equity closings) are the key for the Americas.  It looks like we will have slippage for Q2; I am expecting to see European numbers later this morning and will give you a call to discuss on Friday.  We can also discuss the gearbox issues for the US as to which I am a bit more optimistic than my earlier reports.  Adam

It sounds like the due diligence with UBS is going fairly well with no real surprise.  The news is good on Indian Mesa I and II both on the deal with AEP and the financing.  The real target is completion of the project on time.

I am concerned about slippage again on Q2 due to the Greek project slippage and German installations being behind schedule.  I am looking forward to seeing the Q2 numbers very soon.

What is the issue on the L&S gearbox and what is the potential impact on 01 earnings given your statement that if we do not pass the test, it will present significant problems for 01 US sales.

Let's talk by phone this week if possible.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Dan,
Like you, I also received termination letters from Hewitt (as did Stan Horton, Jim Hughes, Bill Cordes and others).  Last week, I asked Dan Batista from my staff to contact Corporate Benefits to investigate what happened and to what extent.  Dan has reported the following:
 
"Termination letters" were erroneously sent by Hewitt to several active employees.  There was a problem with employee status information that was transmitted via an SAP interface from ENE to Hewitt for the 11/30/01 pay period.  A number of employee records loaded into the Hewitt system with a termination date equal to their employment date.  As the Hewitt system picked up these incorrectly terminated records, letters were triggered to employees informing them of their rights as terminated employees.  The error was identified and has been fixed in the Hewitt system.  All records were reported to be fixed by 12/26/01.  Employees who received termination letters can log into the Savings Plan System under "personal data" to verify that their status has been corrected to "active".  
 
We have asked Corporate Benefits for a listing of employees who received the letters so the HR Reps can follow up with an explanation to those effected.

David, Cindy and Gary, 
     Over the holidays I received not one, but three, notifications letting me know that I had been terminated and explaining my rights under my 401K.  I also received a half a dozen calls at home from other current employees who had received these (including Julie Armstrong), all of whom were not amused.  I understand that this matter has been brought to your attention, but you have chosen not to notify any current employees that the 401K notices were sent out in error.  I suggest that you rethink this asap.

Dan

Thanks Stan -- with Bill's strong involvement this last year, it will
certainly ease the transition next year and all the producers and Julie are
okay with it.  I haven't heard anyone note a concern, and several Board
members have been talking about this since September.  For a while Bill
Benham considered doing it, but then he picked up extra international
responsibilities including Hanoi, so not only could he not do it, but he is
not returning to the Board in 2002 either.  Lots of changes -- Rae

Dear Stan,

Given the current state of affairs here in the D.C. office, I am forwarding my resume for your review.  The lion's share of my legal experience has been with Enron's regulated pipelines, both domestic and overseas.  I appreciate your keeping me in mind should needs or opportunities arise in the pipeline group, whether these be as an employee or on a contract basis.

Thanks for your consideration!  

Kindest regards,  Ray

The Bankruptcy Court has approved our sale of the IM Project to AEP.  The C=
ourt's formal order will be entered sometime Friday morning.  With this app=
roval, we expect to close the sale either Friday or Saturday.  Approval was=
 conditioned upon our agreement to the following procedures with respect to=
 the net sale proceeds (approximately $108mm): =20

=09-=09$25mm will be returned to Enron (repayment of the post-petition work=
ing capital loans made to EW);=20
=09-=09$10mm will be retained by EW for working capital to use over the nex=
t 2 weeks;=20
=09-=09$78mm (the remaining balance) will be set aside in a restricted acco=
unt of EW, pending approval by the creditor's committee of the use of those=
 funds for payment of existing obligations and for ongoing working capital =
by EW. =20

We have until 15 January to obtain creditors' committee approval for the us=
e of the remaining balance, at which time if no approval is obtained, we ca=
n ask the BK Court to rule on the matter.  Obtaining creditors' committee a=
pproval will require that we (a) demonstrate that the continued operation o=
f EW as a going concern is in the bankruptcy estate's best interest (becaus=
e it will enhance or at least maintain the value of EW for sale) - this dem=
onstration will need to be made by Enron (Mark) and CSFB (Matt), and will n=
eed to include an overview of EW's value on sale, including arguments why t=
here is significant value in the EW - Americas business unit notwithstandin=
g the short-term issues facing the US business, and an update on the sale p=
rocess; and (b) demonstrate the legitimacy of EW's current obligations and =
future working capital needs - this will need to be done by Umanoff and Wes=
tbeld (we initially projected that we would need approximately $54mm of the=
 $78mm through the end of Q1, a likely closing date for sale of EW; Mike an=
d his team will be scrubbing these numbers over the next week).  We are tar=
geting early in the week of Jan 7 to make our case to the creditors' commit=
tee, although no firm date has been set.

One final note - a representative of GE attended the BK court hearing and i=
s aware that our request to use the remaining balance to pay our past due o=
bligations (including $9mm owing to GE) was denied pending implementation o=
f the above procedure.  We can expect continued pressure from GE.

Call me with any questions.

Stan,
I am very comfortable delivering the message and I also understand from an earlier chat with Jim that we need to deliver a "related party" perception caution message to him.  I just didn't want to do it until we had all reached consensus that this was the way to go.  If that is the agreement of the team, I'm happy to be the messanger; I will deliver it politely in full respect of the existing relationship.

I will wait to hear from Jeff on your email to him.

Many thanks! Mariella

You have my permission to just refer them to Jeff Donahue.  Jeff is in the process of naming individuals to assist in the disposition of our international assets.  Corporate development, EGAS and investment bankers will collectively pursue the disposition.  I woould think Dr. Boyce should be so advised of the process we are going to use.  Jeff or his designee can deliver this message if you would like.

Jeff, I assume this is the right approach given our converstion.

Jim/Stan;
See below; this is simply further illustration of the problems we will continue to have with this gentleman.  He has simply received royal treatment in terms of the expediency with which information has been provided to him.  I have met with him twice already and have spoken to him on the phone at least three times.  Clearly, based on the email below he is trying to line up investors to do this deal.  You know what my recommendation on this is; I have simply wanted to take a very courteous and responsive approach on this out of respect for the relationship.

Let me know how your mtg with Corp Development went.

Thanks! Mariella
ps: fyi - after fulfilling his round of requests (which came up on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving) I asked if he could please focus on: how to deal with the backstop guarantees that ENE has in the deal and a financing plan (I politely told him we were looking at an all-cash transaction).

We have still not received the information.  I cannot understand why the
same information released to the other parties cannot be released to us.  I
have a number of investors scheduled for a meeting Tuesday morning at 9:00
am, and am very disappointed that I do not have the information as of 7:00pm
Monday

Dan,

I do not know that we decided not to send anything to these employees who received letters in error as a consequence of a mistake by our outsource suppliers. I had understood that they were notifying people that these were errors and correct the information accordingly.

Cynthia, can you confirm for me and the others on this email that we have this in hand?

Thanks

David

David, Cindy and Gary,
     Over the holidays I received not one, but three, notifications letting me know that I had been terminated and explaining my rights under my 401K.  I also received a half a dozen calls at home from other current employees who had received these (including Julie Armstrong), all of whom were not amused.  I understand that this matter has been brought to your attention, but you have chosen not to notify any current employees that the 401K notices were sent out in error.  I suggest that you rethink this asap.

Dan

We plan to complete a teaser letter for bidders and a revised Information Memorandum over the next 2-3 days.  Our target is to send the teaser out on Monday with the IM to follow.  Both will contain revised year-end '01 numbers and '02 projections, which I know you wanted to review before they are released.  I will e-mail you the draft teaser as soon as it is available (probably Saturday) - hopefully, we can chat over the weekend, or at the latest, Monday morning.  Adam

I received some news today about the referenced matter from FBI Special Agent Carl Wake.  Mr. Wake called to verify the name of the EOTT entity that was the victim of Todoroff's activities.  In response to my question as to when we could expect an indictment, Mr. Wake said it should be very soon because the FBI has started seizing some of Todoroff's assets.  According to Mr. Wake, Todoroff has 2 less vehicles than he did at the beginning of the week due to the FBI seizures.  Mr. Wake indicated that Todoroff's assets are being seized in advance of his indictment through an administrative process.  I will attempt to learn more about this process.

As some of you know, Todoroff is attempting to sell his home that is located a few blocks from our former office.  Mr. Wake was well aware of Todoroff's efforts to sell his home.  According to Mr. Wake, the home was constructed in 1997, and Todoroff is seeking a sale price in excess of $1,000,000.

Mr. Wake also indicated he wants to continue his investigation with respect to the payments Todoroff received from one of EOTT's trading counterparties in late 1997 and 1998.  He is developing that matter as a separate investigation, and he thinks it may be a much larger matter involving several individuals.  Lori, Mr. Wake indicated that he would like to compare the records he obtained from the trading counterparty to our records.  I know you were working on obtaining position reports for this time period.  As soon as those are obtained, I want to schedule a meeting with Mr. Wake in order that he may advance that investigation.

Attached for your information is a memo that we plan to send out to employees worldwide Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning discussing the Policy Committee's cost saving recommendations.  To the extent there are unique aspects of these policies as they apply to your business unit, please follow up with a further communication to your employees.  We will send you a list of frequently asked questions that deal with systems issues. 

Thank you.

Karen
